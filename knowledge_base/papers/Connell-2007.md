## 摘要

Embodied theories of cognition hold that mentally representing something red engages the neural subsystems that respond to environmental perception of that colour. This paper examines whether implicit perceptual information on object colour is represented during sentence comprehension even though doing so does not necessarily facilitate task performance. After reading a sentence that implied a particular colour for a given object, participants were presented with a picture of the object that either matched or mismatched the implied colour. When asked if the pictured object was mentioned in the preceding sentence, people's responses were faster when the colours mismatched than when they matched, suggesting that object colour is represented differently to other object properties such as shape and orientation. A distinction between stable and unstable embodied representations is proposed to allow embodied theories to account for these findings.

## 核心內容

### 理論背景

Embodied theories of cognition hold that thought is grounded in the same neural systems that govern sensation, perception and action (Barsalou, 1999; Glenberg & Kaschak, 2002; Johnson-Laird, 1983; Pecher & Zwaan, 2005). Barsalou's (1999) Perceptual Symbol Systems theory states that concepts are essentially partial recordings of the neural activation that arises during perceptual and motor experiences.

### 顏色與其他物體屬性的差異

John Locke (1690/1975) argued for a distinction between primary and secondary object properties:
- **Primary properties** (shape, size, motion): existed independent of observer, could be perceived by multiple senses
- **Secondary properties** (colour, taste, smell): observer-dependent, could be perceived by only one sense

### 實驗設計

- **操作變項**: 句子隱含的物體顏色（匹配 vs. 不匹配）
- **依變項**: 圖片驗證反應時間
- **例如**: "John looked at the steak on his plate" (暗示棕色) vs. "John looked at the steak in the butcher's window" (暗示紅色)

### 核心發現 (Mismatch Advantage)

People responded more quickly when the colour **mismatched** (M = 1215 ms) than when they **matched** (M = 1369 ms), F1(1, 38) = 9.458, p < .005.

This is **opposite** to the match advantage found for shape (Zwaan et al., 2002) and orientation (Stanfield & Zwaan, 2001).

### 穩定與不穩定表徵的區分

The paper proposes a distinction between:
- **Stable representations**: shape, size, motion (multimodal, salient in scene configuration)
- **Unstable representations**: colour, taste, smell (unimodal, less salient)

When perceptual input mismatches simulation on an **unstable** property, there is minimal interference. When perceptual input **matches** simulation, the matching colour information is difficult to ignore and interferes with shape recognition.

## 方法論筆記

- 24 test items (pairs of pictures), 20 filler items
- Pictures pretested for recognition time and quality rating
- Sentences pretested for implied colour
- 44 native English speakers from Northumbria University

## 相關研究脈絡

此研究延伸 Stanfield & Zwaan (2001) 關於方向的研究，但發現顏色表現出相反的效應模式（mismatch advantage 而非 match advantage），提出穩定/不穩定表徵的理論區分。
