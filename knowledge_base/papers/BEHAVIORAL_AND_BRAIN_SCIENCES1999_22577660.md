## 摘要

Prior to the twentieth century, theories of knowledge were inherently perceptual. Since then, developments in logic, statis-
tics, and programming languages have inspired amodal theories that rest on principles fundamentally different from those underlying
perception. In addition, perceptual approaches have become widely viewed as untenable because they are assumed to implement record-
ing systems, not conceptual systems. A perceptual theory of knowledge is developed here in the context of current cognitive science and
neuroscience. During perceptual experience, association areas in the brain capture bottom-up patterns of activation in sensory-motor
areas. Later, in a top-down manner, association areas partially reactivate sensory-motor areas to implement perceptual symbols. The stor-
age and reactivation of perceptual symbols operates at the level of perceptual components –not at the level of holistic perceptual expe-
riences. Through the use of selective attention, schematic representations of perceptual components are extracted from experience and
stored in memory (e.g., individual memories of green, purr, hot). As memories of the same component become organized around a com-
mon frame, they implement a simulator that produces limitless simulations of the component (e.g., simulations of purr). Not only do
such simulators develop for aspects of sensory experience, they also develop for aspects of proprioception (e.g., lift,run)and introspec-
tion (e.g., compare,memory,happy, hungry). Once established, these simulators implement a basic conceptual system that represents
types, supports categorization, and produces categorical inferences. These simulators further support productivity, propositions, and ab-
stract concepts, thereby implementing a fully functional conceptual system. Productivity results from integrating simulators combinato-

Abstract:Prior to the twentieth century, theories of knowledge were inherently perceptual. Since then, developments in logic, statis-
tics, and programming languages have inspired amodal theories that rest on principles fundamentally different from those underlying
perception. In addition, perceptual approaches have become widely viewed as untenable because they are assumed to implement record-
ing systems, not conceptual systems. A perceptual theory of knowledge is developed here in the context of current cognitive science and
neuroscience. During perceptual experience, association areas in the brain capture bottom-up patterns of activation in sensory-motor
areas. Later, in a top-down manner, association areas partially reactivate sensory-motor areas to implement perceptual symbols. The stor-
age and reactivation of perceptual symbols operates at the level of perceptual components –not at the level of holistic perceptual expe-
riences. Through the use of selective attention, schematic representations of perceptual components are extracted from experience and
stored in memory (e.g., individual memories of green, purr, hot). As memories of the same component become organized around a com-
mon frame, they implement a simulator that produces limitless simulations of the component (e.g., simulations of purr). Not only do
such simulators develop for aspects of sensory experience, they also develop for aspects of proprioception (e.g., lift,run)and introspec-
tion (e.g., compare,memory,happy, hungry). Once established, these simulators implement a basic conceptual system that represents
types, supports categorization, and produces categorical inferences. These simulators further support productivity, propositions, and ab-
stract concepts, thereby implementing a fully functional conceptual system. Productivity results from integrating simulators combinato-
rially and recursively to produce complex simulations. Propositions result from binding simulators to perceived individuals to represent
type-token relations. Abstract concepts are grounded in complex simulations of combined physical and introspective events. Thus, a per-
ceptual theory of knowledge can implement a fully functional conceptual system while avoiding problems associated with amodal sym-
bol systems. Implications for cognition, neuroscience, evolution, development, and artificial intelligence are explored.

ages from mentalism, however, but to eliminate mentalism
altogether. As a result, image-based theories of cognition

1.2.Amodal symbol systems
Following the cognitive revolution in the mid-twentieth
century, theorists developed radically new approaches to
representation. In contrast to pre-twentieth century think-
ing, modern cognitive scientists began working with repre-
sentational schemes that were inherently nonperceptual.
To a large extent, this shift reflected major developments

trast, the internal layer of hidden units is often interpreted
as a simple conceptual system, with a pattern of activation
providing the conceptual representation of an input pat-
tern. Most importantly, the relation between a conceptual
representation and its perceptual input is arbitrary for tech-
nical reasons. Prior to learning, the starting weights on the
connections between the input units and the hidden units
are set to small random values (if the values were all 0, the
system could not learn). As a result, the conceptual repre-
sentations that develop through learning are related arbi-
trarily to the perceptual states that activate them. With dif-
ferent starting weights, arbitrarily different conceptual
