Many linguists, philosophers, and anthropologists hold that classifier lan-
guages, including Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Thai, have no count nouns,
and that all their common nouns are mass nouns. This paper argues that Chi-
nese draws a syntactic, as well as semantic, distinction between mass and count
nouns, and suggests how the approach taken to clarify the distinction can be
extended to other classifier languages.
Keywords: classifier, count noun, mass noun hypothesis, number, quantity,
quantifier, measure word
1. Introduction
It is usual to distinguish common nouns into mass and count nouns.1 The
distinction was first drawn by Otto Jespersen in The Philosophy of Gram-
mar (1924, pp. 198ff & 200f), a work on the principles of grammar that
focuses on English and some other related languages. The distinction in
English and the like is closely related to the disparity between two kinds
of numeral noun phrases (in short, NNPs) that can be found in those lan-
guages:
(1) a. three cows
b. three liters of milk
The count noun cow, taking the singular or plural form, can combine

directly with numerals. It yields (1a) by combining with three. The mass
noun milk, by contrast, cannot combine with numerals without the aid of
measure words, e.g., liter. It yields (1b) by combining with three via liter.
But some languages seem not to allow NNPs of the same structure as (1a).
There are languages that use additional expressions called (numeral) classi-
fiers2 in their translations of, e.g., (1a), which makes the translations draw a
syntactic parallel to their translations of, e.g., (1b) (see Tables 1 & 2 in sec-
tion 2). Such languages, called classifier languages, include Chinese, Japa-
nese, Korean, Thai, and many other East and Southeast Asian languages.
Many linguists, philosophers, and anthropologists appeal to this feature of
classifier languages, together with a few other features that they seem to
share, to hold the Mass Noun Hypothesis:3
Mass Noun Hypothesis:
(MH1) Classifier languages have no count nouns.
(MH2) All the common nouns of classifier languages are mass nouns.
On their view, all the NNPs of those languages involve classifiers because
their nouns, being mass nouns, require measure words to combine with
numerals. This is now the standard view on classifier languages.
But I think it is a mistaken view based on superficial examinations of clas-
sifier languages. The linguistic distinction between mass and count nouns is
closely related to the ontological distinction between stuff and individuals,
and that between the quantity (i.e., amount) of stuff and number of indi-
viduals.4 Many studies of animals’ and human infants’ cognition of number
suggest that humans conceive individuals and their numbers differently
from stuff and its quantity without or before acquiring languages.5 More-

ably with numeral classifier.

Chierchia (1998), and Borer (2005, p. 93f).

tains to individuals as well as stuff. Cows, as well as water, have weight and volume.

over, some recent studies show that both English- and Japanese-speaking
children, as early as when they are two years old, have a grasp of the stuff/
individual distinction, and use it to learn the meanings of nouns (see Soja et
al. (1990), and Imai & Gentner (1997)).6 And I think there is good linguistic
reason to think that classifier languages, too, distinguish mass and count
nouns. So I propose a conjecture opposite to the Mass Noun Hypothesis:
Count Noun Hypothesis:
(CH1) Classifier languages have count nouns as well as mass nouns.
(CH2) T hey have morphosyntactic devices for distinguishing count
nouns from mass nouns.
This paper aims to support this hypothesis with a close scrutiny of Chinese.
2. Classifier Languages and the Mass Noun Hypothesis
Classifier languages, or many of them, share several features that some
might take to support the Mass Noun Hypothesis. To get an idea of the
grounds for the hypothesis, it is useful to note the devices commonly used
to draw the distinction for English:7 (a) the grammatical number distinction
(or the singular-plural morphology); (b) the indefinite article a/an; (c) many
and much; few and little; (d) quantifiers: each, every, several, etc.; and (e)
numerals: one, five, a score of, etc. Most of the above-mentioned devices
have no counterparts in classifier languages, such as Chinese, Japanese,
Korean, or Thai. (a*) These languages draw no grammatical number distinc-
tion. (b*) They have no articles. (c*) And they have no exact counterparts of
many and much, which pertain to number and quantity, respectively. Instead
they have one word that amounts to a lot: the Chinese henduo, Korean
man(h)-, etc. Those words have the number/quantity duality, and cover both
many and much. (And it is the same with their analogues of few and little.)
number.
6 Two year old English-speaking children have not yet acquired the morphosyn-
tactic devices necessary for distinguishing English count nouns from mass nouns.
7 See, e.g., Pelletier & Schubert (2003, p. 250f) for a standard presentation of the
distinction.

Moreover, nouns of classifier languages, it seems, cannot directly com-
bine with numerals.8 Consider the following translations of three cows into
the above-mentioned languages:
Table 1. Translations of ‘Three Cows’
Korean Japanese Chinese Thai
so sey mali ushi san tou was saam tua
cow three CL cow three CL cow three CL
sey mali-uy so san tou-no ushi san tou niu
three CL-gen cow three CL-gen cow three CL cow
In addition to the counterparts of cow and three, these phrases have the
classifiers that match nouns for animals: mali (Korean), tou (Japanese), tou
(Chinese), and tua (Thai). This makes the translations of three cows draw
syntactic parallels to the translations of, e.g., three pounds of meat into the
same languages:
Table 2. Translations of ‘Three Pounds of Meat’
Korean Japanese Chinese Thai
koki sey kun niku san paundo nua saam pon
cow three pound meat three pound meat three pound
sey kun-uy koki san paundo-no niku san bang (de) rou
3 pound-gen meat 3 pound-gen meat 3 pound (de) meat
For the classifiers used in the former take the positions of the measure
words in the latter.
What does all this mean? Some argue that it supports the Mass Noun
Hypothesis. They assume that the classifiers in the translations of three
8 Although this is commonly held, it is not quite correct because classifiers are not
mandatory in many classifier languages. In addition to the two forms of NNPs list-
ed in Table 1, Korean, for example, has two classifier-free forms: (i) Num+N, and
(ii) N+Num. See, e.g., Martin (1992, p. 171ff), Sohn (1999, p. 352f), Lee & Ramsey
(2000, p. 97ff), and Lee & Chae (2002, p. 143) for discussions of the various forms
of Korean NNPs. Note that the existence of classifier-free forms of NNPs in a clas-
sifier language militates against the Mass Noun Hypothesis.

Chinese Classifiers and Count Nouns 213
cows, like measure words, pertain to the measurement of the quantity of
stuff, and conclude that the counterparts of cow are mass nouns. They argue
that this is why those nouns call for the additional items, classifiers, in
NNPs, and that it can explain other notable features of classifier languages
as well: the grammatical number system, indefinite article, and counterparts
of many and few would play no role in languages with no count nouns.
But this argument for the Mass Noun Hypothesis has a conspicuous prob-
lem. Languages with all the above-mentioned features might have other
devices that one can use to distinguish count nouns from mass nouns. In
particular, they might have counterparts of quantifiers listed in (d): each,
every, several, etc. I shall argue that Chinese, like many other classifier lan-
guages, has count nouns because it has a counterpart of each (viz., geh 各)
that selects count nouns.9 Before I do so, it is useful to examine a different
attempt to draw the mass/count distinction for Chinese.
3. Chao on Chinese Classifiers and Count Nouns
Yuen Ren Chao (1968, p. 507ff) distinguished Chinese nouns into mass
and count nouns more than four decades ago. (He uses an apt term for
count nouns, individual noun.) Although his formulation of the distinction
has some infelicities, I think it eventually leads to one successful formula-
tion.
Chao draws a “formal” or syntactic distinction between mass and count
nouns of Chinese. To do so, he formulates two tests for count nouns:
(C1) “ Mass nouns do not take the individual classifier” ge, 個 (ibid., p.
508f).
(C2) B etween the numeral phrase of the form Num+CL*10 and the
noun N, “one can insert an optional de for mass nouns but not for
individual nouns”, i.e., count nouns (ibid., p. 509).
9 I discuss geh in section 4. It is homonymous with the classifier ge, 個, discussed
in section 3, and both are spelled ge in pinyin. To avoid confusion, however, I fol-
low Chao (1968) in romanizing the former as geh.
10 I use ‘CL*’ for the category of numeratives that includes classifiers and mea-
sure words. See note 11 below.
07Yi_Re_사.indd 213 2010-01-11 오후 4:32:20

214 Byeong-Uk Yi
I think (C2) is wrong. But I think (C1), Chao’s main criterion recently redis-
covered by Zhang (2009), leads to one good test for count nouns.
Let us first see why (C2) fails. To do so, it is useful to consider Chao’s
distinction of numeratives, which include classifiers and measure words.11
He (ibid., p. 584ff) distinguishes eight kinds thereof. They include: (a) (indi-
vidual) classifiers or individual measures (e.g., tou (CL:animal)); (b) group
measures (e.g., zu ‘group’); (c) partitive measures (e.g., fen ‘portion, share’);
(d) container measures (e.g., wan ‘bowl’); and (e) standard measures (ma
‘yard’).12 The category of classifiers (or “individual measures”) is closely
related to that of count nouns (or “individual nouns”). Chao says that count
nouns “are [in general] associated with their specific classifiers, so that in
dictionaries the specific classifier must be cited under each individual noun
to identify its class” (ibid., p. 507). Now, some of the non-classifier numera-
tives (e.g., the group measure zu ‘group’) can match nouns to be considered
count nouns (e.g., niu ‘cow’) to yield NNPs with de (e.g., san zu de niu ‘three
groups of cows’). So (C2) is false.13
But I think (C1) yields a good test for Chinese count nouns. According to
(C1), the classifier ge is not applicable to mass nouns: shui ‘water’, niunai
‘milk’, rou ‘meat’, etc. If so, nouns that can take ge must be count nouns. It
11 Many Chinese linguists (e.g., Cheng & Sybesma) use classifier broadly to in-
clude all measure words, without distinguishing classifiers and measure words. But
Chao (1968, p. 584ff) uses measure word (or measure) broadly, and classifier for just
one of the eight kinds of “measures” that he distinguishes. I follow Chao in using
classifier in its narrow and proper sense (I do not think classifiers pertain to measure-
ment of quantity), but use measure (word), too, in its narrow and proper sense. For
I think there is an important contrast between classifiers in the proper sense and the
English measure words (and their classifier language counterparts). I use numerative
as a broad term that covers both classifiers and measure words (and some others).
12 The other three kinds are: classifiers associated with V-O constructions, tempo-
rary measures, and quasi-measures.
13 Chao (1968, pp. 555 & 588) formulates a modification of (C2): classifiers can-
not take de. Cheng & Sybesma (1998; 1999) use this as their main test for classi-
fiers (which they call count-classifiers). But Chao, unlike Cheng & Sybesma, does
not hold that it gives a sufficient condition for classifiers; some group measures
(e.g., dui ‘pair’), he says, cannot take de. See Zhang (2009) for other problems with
Cheng & Sybesma’s tests for classifiers.

is straightforward to extend this test to Japanese and Korean, which have
cognate classifiers, ko (or -tu) and kay, respectively. I recently came to inde-
pendently realize that the cousin of (C1) holds for Korean, and learned from
Niina Zhang (p.c. Jan. 1, 2009) and Takashi Iida (p.c. Jan. 5, 2009) that (C1)
and its Japanese cousin hold for Chinese and Japanese, respectively, as well.
(Thanks are due to them.)
Whether or not a noun can take ge, however, would seem to have noth-
ing to do with the usual mass/count distinction for non-classifier languages
(e.g., English). If so, what is the reason for taking the ge test to pertain to
the mass/count distinction, rather than to a distinction between two kinds of
mass nouns? To answer this question, it is necessary to give an account of
the function of the classifier.
To do so, it is useful to compare ge with some of the group measures: dui
‘pair’, shuang ‘pair’, and da (Chinese transliteration of the English dozen).
Their English counterparts figuring in two pairs of pigeons, several doz-
ens of classifiers, etc. can match only count nouns. (Note that Pelletier &
Schubert (2003, p. 250f), for example, lists their sibling, scores of, as one
of the counting phrases, which cannot match mass nouns.) Similarly, those
Chinese group measures can match only count nouns.14 Now, the group
measures can be considered cousins of numerals, namely, grammatical-
ized versions of numerals that might apply only to certain things that meet
certain conditions. Two pairs of shoes, pigeons, or pebbles are four (i.e., two
times two) shoes, pigeons, or pebbles that meet certain conditions. Just as
pair relates to two, so do dui (or shuang) and da relate to two and twelve,
respectively. It is the same, I think, with ge (and other classifiers) except
that they relate to one.
To see this, note that the talk of a pair or dozen of certain things presup-
poses the talk of individuals that form the pair or dozen: individual shoes,
individual pigeons, individual pebbles, etc. The classifier ge relates to this
very notion of individual, which contrasts with the notion of group or of all
the things belonging to a group. Accordingly, the Chinese word ge is also
used as an adjective meaning individual, and as the first component of the
noun for individuals: ge.ti, which literally means individual body; and it is
14 Note that this by itself suffices to show that Chinese has count nouns. See the
first paragraph of section 4.
07Yi_Re_사.indd 215 2010-01-11 오후 4:32:20

216 Byeong-Uk Yi
the same with its Japanese and Korean cognates. Now, the notion of indi-
vidual does not pertain to mass nouns. We do not talk of individual water,
because water does not relate to a group to which individuals belong – the
relation that a portion of water some has to water differs from the relation
that an individual cow has to a group of cows (or to all the cows). So a
mass noun cannot take ge, and taking ge is a mark of count nouns. Given
the connection between ge and the notion of individual, we might say that
the phrase yi ge gezi (one CL pigeon ‘one pigeon’), for example, means
one individual pigeon. This does not mean that ge, used as a classifier, is an
analogue of the English adjective individual. Here again, comparison with
dui, shuang, and da is useful. The classifier, like these group measures, is
a cousin of numerals, namely, a grammaticalized version of the numeral
for one. To say that something is yi ge gezi is to say that it is one times one
pigeon (i.e., one pigeon). The classifier relates to the notion of individual
through its connection to the notion of one. For to be an individual pigeon,
for example, is to be one pigeon or one of the pigeons.
It is the same, I think, with other classifiers, which, like ge, are called
individual measures in contrast to group measures by Chao. One of the
classifiers is zhi (CL:one-of-a-pair), which relates to one of a pair of certain
things (e.g., a hand). It is a version of the numeral for one that is applicable
to something only if it is (or is considered as) one of two things that form a
pair. So it has a clear relation to dui or shuang ‘pair’.
The specific classifier tou, for example, which applies only to animals,
is a grammaticalized version of yi ‘one’ that has restricted application. It
might be useful to compare this with the English pronoun she (or he). The
latter might be semantically decomposed into two parts: the pure pronoun
part, and the part relating to its restriction to females (or males). In some
languages, the decomposition is transparent: the Korean counterpart of she,
ku.nye, has two morphemes: ku, which indicates the pronoun function, and
nye, which comes from the noun for females. Classifiers, I suggest, work
like English demonstratives she, rather than its Korean counterpart, in the
way it marks the restriction on their use.
Now, does Chinese have an unrestricted cousin of yi ‘one’, a classifier that
can be used for things of any kind whatsoever? Such classifiers are called
general classifiers, and they are classifiers that can match any count noun.
07Yi_Re_사.indd 216 2010-01-11 오후 4:32:20

Chinese Classifiers and Count Nouns 217
(Mass nouns, recall, take no classifiers.) Chao, it seems, holds that ge is
such a classifier:
(C1*) T he classifier ge “is applicable to all [count] nouns” (ibid., p.
588).
This, together with (C1), yields a syntactic characterization of Chinese
count nouns:
(C) A noun (of Chinese) is a count noun if, and only if, it can take ge.
Whether (C1*) holds, however, seems to be controversial. To discuss
whether it holds or not, we would need an independent condition for count
nouns. (Chao’s second test for count nouns, (C2), might have yielded such
a condition, but we have seen that (C2) does not hold.) We will see a few
independent conditions for count nouns in section 4. For now, however, we
can approach the question by noting that the following holds for the reason
explained above:15
(C3) A noun (of Chinese) is a count noun if it has a specific classifier.
(Also recall that nouns that can take dui ‘pair’, shuang ‘pair’, da ‘dozen’,
etc. are count nouns.) If so, can one use ge in place of any specific classi-
fier? Chao gives a somewhat cautious answer to this question: the classifier
ge “is a possible alternate for almost any . . . classifier” (ibid., p. 508; my
italics). Here he seems to envisage possible exceptions to (C1*), although he
does not give any specific exceptions. Li & Thompson (1981) do not give a
completely positive answer to the question, either. They say ge “is gradually
becoming the general classifier and replacing the more specialized ones”
(1981, p. 112). If so, it might not yet have become the general classifier.16
15 See Chao’s passage on classifiers and count nouns (ibid., p. 507) quoted in the
third paragraph of this section.
16 Although Korean has a cognate classifier, kay, and it is often said to be a gen-
eral classifier, it applies only to nouns for inanimate things, not to, e.g., kwun.in ‘sol-
dier’. See Lee & Ramsey (2000, p. 88). Youngwha Kim (p.c. July 11, 2009) confirms
07Yi_Re_사.indd 217 2010-01-11 오후 4:32:21

218 Byeong-Uk Yi
Whether (C1*) holds or not, we can formulate an alternative that pre-
serves its spirit:
(C1**) A noun (of Chinese) is a count noun only if it can take a classi-
fier.
This holds because a count noun takes either a specific classifier or else ge.
Most count nouns have classifiers specific to them, and count nouns with no
specific classifiers, as Chao says, can take ge (ibid., p. 508).17 This yields the
following characterization of count nouns:
(C*) A noun (of Chinese) is a count noun if, and only if, it can take a
classifier.
For mass nouns can take neither ge nor any other classifiers, which also
pertain to individuals: individual persons, individual animals, etc. The Chi-
nese noun shui ‘water’ and niunai ‘milk’, for example, can take no classifier,
because the notions of individual and one pertain no more to these than to
their English counterparts.
This means, note, that the proper use of ge, be it a general classifier or
not, requires distinguishing count nouns from mass nouns. Chinese speak-
ers must understand the distinction to decide whether or not to use ge for
nouns with no specific classifiers: if they are count nouns, one can use ge as
a back-up; if not, one cannot do so.
4. Count Nouns of Chinese
I think (C*) encapsulates an important insight. Note that it does not rest
this with various examples; and Chungmin Lee (p.c. July 11, 2009) points out that
kay is used as a general classifier in children’s speech. But the Chinese ge is used
much more widely, as Zhang (2009) shows. Martin (2004, p. 768) says the Japanese
-tu is a general classifier.
17 So we might say that ge is a generic classifier, one that can be used when no
specific classifier is available, whether or not it is a general classifier. I think its Ko-
rean cognate, kay, is a generic, but not a general, classifier.

Chinese Classifiers and Count Nouns 219
on what one calls classifiers. Whether one calls them count-classifiers,
sortal classifiers, individual measures, individual classifiers, or simply
classifiers is irrelevant. The crucial point is that among the numeratives
of Chinese (or any other classifier language), there is a distinct group that
includes those that relate to the notion of individual via the notion of one,
and thus pertain only to a special group of nouns that can be called count
nouns (Jespersen) or individual nouns (Chao). Proponents of the Mass
Noun Hypothesis deny this. They hold that all nouns of classifier languages
are mass nouns because there are no numeratives that relate to the notion
of individual. But this is clearly wrong. Some of the siblings of classifiers,
such as dui/shuang (‘pair’) or da (‘dozen’), have transparent connections to
English expressions that relate to the notion of individual through their con-
nection to numerals (e.g., ‘pair’ or ‘dozen’).
We can now see that the Mass Noun Hypothesis results from applying
a wrong model of numeratives to classifiers. Clearly, the ‘gallon’ or ‘cup’
model fails to apply to English counting expressions, such as ‘pair’, ‘dozen’,
or ‘score’. If so, it is wrong to assume that the model applies to all numera-
tives of classifier languages, including classifiers. It does not apply to the
Chinese counterparts of ‘pair’ and ‘dozen’, and there is no reason to take
classifiers to be closer to ‘gallon’ or ‘cup’ than to ‘pair’ or ‘dozen’. The Chi-
nese NNP san tou niu (three CL cow ‘three cows’), for example, draws no
more syntactic parallel to three gallons of milk or three cups of water than
to three dozens of cows (or three dozen cows). And there are many good
reasons to compare classifiers to ‘pair’ or ‘dozen’, as we have seen.
Applying the ‘pair’ or ‘dozen’ model to classifiers, one can reach the
account of classifier presented in section 3: classifiers, like ‘dozen’, can
match only count nouns. I think the account is on the right track. But it
has limitations in relating the mass/count distinction drawn for Chinese to
the distinction drawn for non-classifier languages. (C*) characterizes count
nouns by invoking a special group of numeratives, viz., classifiers. So it
fails to yield a syntactic characterization of Chinese count nouns–unless
one can supplement it with a syntactic characterization of classifiers.18 More
18 Chao’s modification of (C2) mentioned in note 13 is meant to give such a char-
acterization of classifiers, but it fails to yield a correct characterization of classifiers
(see note 13).
07Yi_Re_사.indd 219 2010-01-11 오후 4:32:21

220 Byeong-Uk Yi
importantly, even if one can give such a characterization of classifiers, it is
not clear how (C*), as supplemented with the characterization, relates to the
usual characterization of the mass/count distinction for non-classifier lan-
guages. In this connection, it is useful to note that compare it with (C). (C)
yields a correct syntactic characterization of Chinese count nouns provided
that the classifier ge has become a general classifier. Even if this holds,
however, it would be due to an accidental feature of ge. So one cannot auto-
matically extend (C) to other classifier languages, even those with cognates
of ge (e.g., Korean), to give syntactic characterizations of their count nouns.
It would be much harder to link (C) or (C*) to the usual characterizations of
count nouns for non-classifier languages.
Some might suggest that this is unavoidable. They might hold that there
is bound to be a substantial gap between the mass/count distinction for clas-
sifier languages and the distinction for the other languages because one can-
not characterize count nouns of classifier languages without invoking the
distinction between classifiers and other numeratives. Aikhenvald seems to
suggest this when she says “In numeral classifier languages, the distinction
between countable and uncountable nouns is realized through classifiers and
quantifiers [i.e., some of the other numeratives]” (2003, p. 249). Cheng &
Sybesma are more explicit. They hold that in Chinese, “the count-mass dis-
tinction is grammatically encoded at the level of the classifiers [i.e., numera-
tives]” (1998, p. 410) because “in a language without number morphology,
the semantic [character] of count nouns is not made visible . . . except by
using [numeratives]” (1999, p. 520; my italics). I disagree.
Although Korean linguists do not usually draw the mass/count distinc-
tion for Korean, some of them argue that the distinction applies to Korean
as well.19 Most of the devices that they invoke to draw the distinction for
Korean are not classifiers or other numeratives, and they have more trans-
parent connections to the devices used in the usual mass/count distinction.
Moreover, I think some of those devices have counterparts in many clas-
sifier languages. Let me give a brief sketch of the Chinese counterparts of
such devices.
First, Chinese has the adverb geh ‘each’, the counterpart of the English
19 See, e.g., Kang (1994, p. 3), Noma (2002, pp. 276f & 292), and Yi (2008; 2009).
Kang (1994) gives references to earlier works.
07Yi_Re_사.indd 220 2010-01-11 오후 4:32:21

Chinese Classifiers and Count Nouns 221
determiner each used adverbially, as in, e.g., ‘They have each decided,
haven’t they?’ Like each, geh can help to create contexts that admit only
count nouns. Consider, e.g., the following sentence:
(2) Niu (dou) geh you changchu he duanchu.
cow (all) each have strength and shortcoming
‘ Each cow has strengths and shortcomings.’
Just as the underlined cow can be replaced only by count nouns, so can the
underlined niu be replaced only by count nouns. Second, Chinese, like any
other languages, has size adjectives: da ‘big’, xiao ‘small’, etc. And size
adjectives, as Bunt (1985, p. 199) notes, cannot combine with mass nouns
(*big water, for example, is not well-formed).20 Third, henduo ‘a lot’ is the
Chinese analogue of many and much. It does not simply amount to much, as
the Mass Noun Hypothesis predicts, but has the number/quantity duality, as
noted in section 2. That is, it pertains to the number of certain things (e.g.,
cows) when it combines with count nouns, and to the quantity of some stuff
(e.g., meat) when it combines with mass nouns: henduo niu means many
cows, but henduo rou means much meat. Now, the quantifier cannot have
this duality unless Chinese has count nouns as well as mass nouns. And the
resolution of its duality when it combines with nouns yields a distinction
between mass and count nouns.21
These devices, as I have noted, are the Chinese counterparts of devices
found in Korean. I think the same devices can be found in Japanese and
many other classifier languages as well. In fact, I find it hard to imagine
full-blown languages with no such devices whether they employ classifiers
or not. This is the grounds on which I propose the Count Noun Hypothesis:
20 Thanks are due to Chungmin Lee for pointing this out, and to Niina Zhang for
reference to Bunt (1985).
21 There are some devices specific to Chinese. Chinese counterparts of this water
and this cow, for example, have an interesting disparity: the counterpart of this cow
has a classifier, but the other does not. One can explain this by appealing to the fact
that the Chinese nouns shui and niu (‘water’ and ‘cow’) are mass and count, respec-
tively. See my “Towards count nouns of classifier languages: the Chinese route”,
unpublished manuscript.

classifier languages not only have count nouns as well as mass nouns, but
have devices that one can use to draw a syntactic distinction between the
two kinds of nouns.
Those who hold the opposite hypothesis, the Mass Noun Hypothesis,
assume that all numeratives of classifier languages have the same function,
that they specify the units for measuring quantities. But this assumption is
clearly wrong. Just as it is wrong to take ‘pair’, ‘couple, or ‘dozen’ to have
the same function as ‘liter’, ‘pound’, or ‘cup’, so is it wrong to take clas-
sifier language counterparts of the former to have the same function as
classifier language counterparts of the latter. And there are good reasons, as
we have seen, to take classifiers to be closer to the former than to the lat-
ter. This leads one to the view that classifiers are cousins of the numerals
for one, namely, their grammaticalized forms. To say that some things are
three pairs of cows, for example, is say that they are three times two cows
(that satisfy some extra conditions). Similarly, to say that some things are
san tou niu ‘three CL cow’, for example, is to say that they are three times
one cows (that satisfy some extra conditions). If so, taking classifiers is a
mark of count nouns just as taking the counting phrases (e.g., ‘pair of’ or
‘dozen of’) is a mark of count nouns. Then languages with classifiers must
have count nouns. And Chinese, we have seen, has some other expressions
that can combine only with count nouns, such as geh ‘each’ and da ‘big’.
Just as ‘*big water’ and ‘*Each water is thirst-quenching’ are ill-formed, so
are their Chinese counterparts. I suggest that the situation is essentially the
same with other classifiers languages. And I leave it for another occasion
to spell out the details by examining the devices for distinguishing count
nouns from mass nouns in other classifier languages, and to fully develop
the account of the function of classifiers sketched in this paper.

Chinese Classifiers and Count Nouns 223
Jeong especially for reference to Chao’s book, and Mutshumi Imai, Kei
Yoshimoto, Niina Zhang, and three anonymous referees of Journal of Cog-
nitive Science for helpful comments on earlier versions of this paper. I am
greatly indebted to Takashi Iida, whose early work on Japanese nouns and
classifiers is the only one that I know to date that argues, correctly on my
view, that Japanese has count nouns. I am most grateful to his constant and
generous advice and support, as well as instructions on Japanese, through-
out my slow progress.
