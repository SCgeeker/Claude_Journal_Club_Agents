PREFACE
For those who do not share the conviction that bits of knowledge laid end to end lead to
wisdom, the articulation of the bits becomes a challenge separate from that of unearthing
them. When the knowledge in question is knowledge about human behavior, the emergent
image must bear a human face. If it doesn’t, the mind goes blank when we look at it, irre-
spective of how detailed or precise it is. So there are two tasks, really: first, the assembly of
the pieces, and second, the discernment of a human face.
— Melvin Konner (2002, p. xvi)
For the past 15 years, a framed reproduction of a prehistoric cave painting has been
hanging above the fireplace in my home. The original pictograph is located at one of the
many ancient rock art sites in southern Africa, some of which are at least 27,000 years
old. Following traditions of style and content that were maintained for millennia, it
portrays, in shades of maroon, yellow, black, and white, a variety of giraffes, elephants,
rhinoceros, and eland, as well as several small groups of very tall, thin people, some
carrying spears and others torches.
For me, this beautiful work of art is not just a nice decoration; it is also a vivid reminder
of the lifeways that our hunter- gatherer ancestors led for over 90% of human history
(Reich, 2018). Although those lifeways were quite different from our own, they undoubt-
edly depended on languages that were no less expressive than those currently spoken all
over the world. After all, people then had essentially the same cognitive capacities that we
have now, including the ability to weave the fabrics of their cultures with words. That is
why, if I extrapolate rather liberally from recent findings about the conversational patterns
of contemporary Ju/’ hoan (!Kung) Bushmen in southern Africa, I can easily imagine that
their forebears in the deep past— forebears like the people illustrated in my painting—
devoted most of their day talk to the nitty- gritty details of food sharing, kinship dues, and
land rights, whereas at night they gathered around their fires to relax and tell elaborate
stories that were richly embellished with gestures, sound effects, and bursts of song, that
were by turns amusing, exciting, and endearing, and that took listeners on virtual journeys
through space and time so as to inform them about the social and emotional intricacies of
marriage, intergroup relations, and trance healing (Weissner, 2014).
But while it is not hard for me to imagine in general terms what the people in my
painting tended to talk about so many years ago, it is nearly impossible for me to get
a specific sense of what their language was like, especially regarding the aspects of it
that interest me most— namely, the meanings of its major symbolic units, which is
to say, its morphemes, words, idioms, and grammatical constructions. This is not just
because the language in question existed before the invention of writing and hence
was never recorded, or because its referential resources cannot be fully reconstructed
from information about the contemporary tongues that descended from it. It is also,
vii

and more fundamentally, because even though there are many similarities in how
human languages carve up the world into multifarious conceptual categories, there
are far more differences. Indeed, these differences are so dramatic that when speakers
of one language— say, English— first encounter some of the words and phrases
that are frequently used by speakers of an unrelated language— say, Central Yup’ik
(Eskimo- Aleut, Alaska), or Tzeltal (Mayan, Mexico), or Yélî Dnye (Papuan, Rossel
Island)1— they often find the meanings of those expressions to be quite surprising
and peculiar, if not, in some cases, exotic. As Evans (2010, p. 45) observes, even sea-
soned scholars are frequently gobsmacked by what they discover in the course of
their research: “One of the most exciting things about linguistic fieldwork is the way
it continuously pushes the bounds of preconceived possibility, by stumbling upon
‘unimaginable’ languages— those that would never have been thought possible.”
According to the best current estimate, nearly 6,500 mutually unintelligible languages
are (or recently were) spoken on the planet (Hammarström, 2016).2 And as Pagel (2012,
p. viii) points out, “this is more different systems of communication in a single mammal
species— for that is what we are—t han there are mammal species.” Unfortunately, how-
ever, many living languages are either endangered or already dying, and it is likely that
at least half of them will go extinct during this century, as a few dominant ones, such as
English and Mandarin Chinese, gradually take over the world (Crystal, 2000). This is
nothing short of tragic, since every language not only provides a unique window into the
workings of the human mind, but is also bound up with an ethnic group’s identity and
self- esteem. In a recent article in the New York Times about an inspiring effort to preserve
one particular language— specifically, Southern Haida (Haida, British Columbia)—t he
anthropologist Wade Davis captured the significance of the project in a rather poignant
manner: “The loss of one language is akin to clear- cutting an old- growth forest of the
mind. The world’s complex web of myths, beliefs and ideas—t he ethnosphere—i s torn,
just as the loss of a species weakens the biosphere” (Porter, 2017).

On the bright side, however, the rate at which vulnerable languages are being
described and compared has been accelerating, and as a result the database has
been rapidly growing (e.g., see the Mouton Grammar Library3 and the World Atlas
of Language Structures Online4). Within the broad field of linguistics, the division
that concentrates on cross- linguistic similarities and differences is called typology,
and within it the branch that focuses even more narrowly on conceptual represen-
tation is called semantic typology (e.g., Evans, 2010, 2011; Malt & Majid, 2013;
Moore et al., 2015). Although this area of specialization is still maturing, it has begun
to flourish during the past few decades, as shown by increasingly systematic and in-
sightful studies of numerous conceptual realms, including colors, plants and animals
(i.e., ethnobiology), body parts, landscapes, spatial relations, possession, and several
spheres of action, such as giving, cutting and breaking, putting and taking, and eating
and drinking. These investigations have shown that far- flung languages all over the
world display many intriguing correspondences in both the content and structure
of the concepts they encode— correspondences that may stem from commonalities
in people’s bodies, brains, communicative behaviors, and physical and social
environments. At the same time, however, these investigations have also revealed a
tremendous amount of cross- linguistic diversity in the lexical partitioning and pack-
aging of particular semantic domains, and in the aspects of experience that speakers
must regularly express in grammatical constructions and hence habitually track.
Now, in response to such variation, one could just throw up one’s hands and ex-
claim, “So what? It all originates from the same underlying semantic system.” Such
an attitude, however, would treat as disproportionately special whatever universal
constraints on meaning turn out to be true, and downplay as comparatively trivial all of
the cross- linguistic conceptual differences that have been disclosed. In sharp contrast,
an increasing number of scholars have been arguing that if there is any asymmetry of
significance, it actually goes the other way, since cross-l inguistic differences in meaning
come primarily from culture, and culture is what ultimately explains the evolutionary
success of our species (e.g., Tomasello, 1999, 2014; Richerson & Christiansen, 2013;

x Preface
Henrich, 2016; Boyd, 2018; Heyes, 2018). Here is how Stephen Levinson, one of the
most influential semantic typologists, recently put it (Levinson, 2012b, p. 397):
In the language sciences, there is a slow, growing realization that this diversity is the
most striking feature of human language—t here is no other animal on the planet, as
far as we know, which has such myriad variants of form and meaning at every level
in its communication system. What this feature of language ought to convey to us
with special force is that culture is the peculiar human adaptive trick that has made it
possible for us to invade and dominate almost every terrestrial niche on the planet.
Classical cognitive science treats humans like an asocial species without culture, and
in doing so, it misses the heart of the human phenomenon.
Semantic typology has already had a strong influence on developmental
psychologists who investigate the acquisition of language during childhood (e.g.,
Bowerman & Levinson, 2001; Guo et al., 2008) and on cognitive scientists who ex-
plore the relation between language and thought (e.g., Gentner & Goldin- Meadow,
2003; Malt & Wolff, 2010). Unfortunately, however, it has not yet had much impact
on the sizable branch of cognitive neuroscience that studies the organization, repre-
sentation, and processing of concepts in the brain. To be sure, this field of research has
been making spectacular progress in illuminating the large- scale cortical networks—
and, to some extent, the fine- grained cell assemblies— that subserve both verbal and
nonverbal concepts (e.g., Binder & Desai, 2011; Pulvermüller, 2013a; Yee et al., 2013;
Clarke & Tyler, 2015; Kemmerer, 2015c; Lambon Ralph et al., 2017). But it has been
laboring, for the most part, under the mistaken assumption that the concepts found
in English and a few other familiar languages exemplify those found in languages
worldwide. Because of this powerful bias, which is usually implicit, very few scholars
have voiced any concern about the fact that the lion’s share of empirical and theoret-
ical work has been based on what Henrich et al. (2010) provocatively call WEIRD
societies— i.e., societies that are Western(ized), educated, industrial, rich, and dem-
ocratic. Consequently, the field as a whole has so far failed to take into account the
huge variety of semantic systems that are manifested in the roughly 6,500 living lan-
guages around the globe and that are also, ipso facto, implemented in the brains of the
speakers.
In light of these considerations, the main goal of this book is to raise awareness
about the many ways in which semantic typology can contribute to cognitive neu-
roscience, with an eye toward showing that no neuroscientific theory of human con-
ceptual knowledge can ever achieve comprehensive, species- wide coverage unless it
accommodates the remarkable range of cross-l inguistic similarities and differences in
the lexical and grammatical representation of meaning.
The purpose of Part I is to elaborate the typological and neuroscientific approaches
to studying concepts. Chapter 1, “The Perspective from Semantic Typology,” begins
by describing the widespread tendency to incorrectly assume that one’s own language
maps onto reality in a natural and impartial way. Then it devotes separate sections to
lexical and grammatical semantics, in each case reviewing cross- linguistic research on
universals and idiosyncrasies, conceptual fields, and coding patterns. Next, Chapter 2,
“The Perspective from Cognitive Neuroscience,” first elaborates how, in this area of in-
quiry, most theories of conceptual knowledge posit both modal (i.e., sensory, motor,

xi Preface
and affective) and transmodal (i.e., integrative) levels of representation. Then it goes
on to discuss representational similarity spaces in the brain, the lack of sufficient
neuroscientific attention to grammatical semantics, and the captivating notion that
linguistic communication involves brain- to- brain coupling.
The aim of Part II is to show that a synthesis of the two approaches surveyed in
Part I can lead to a more unified and inclusive understanding of several domains of
concrete meaning— domains that I have deliberately chosen so as to maximize the
potential for inter- disciplinary cross- fertilization.5 Most importantly, all three of the
chapters in this central part of the book (but especially Chapters 3 and 4) make two
overarching points: on the one hand, many cross-l inguistic conceptual phenomena
conform to, and hence help to substantiate, salient results and ideas in cognitive neu-
roscience; on the other hand, current neuroscientific theories and research programs
may need to be revised and expanded to handle the full range of semantic variation.
Here’s a brief preview of the main topics that are covered. Chapter 3, “Objects,” first
discusses four conceptual domains that have received substantial attention in both se-
mantic typology and cognitive neuroscience— namely, plants, animals, artifacts, and
body parts—a nd then it turns to two realms of grammatical meaning that have been
studied much more intensively in the former field than in the latter— namely, posses-
sion and nominal classification systems. Chapter 4, “Actions,” has a similar structure. It
initially addresses several conceptual domains that have been explored from the dual
perspectives of typology and neuroscience— namely, motion events, and events of
cutting, breaking, and opening— and then it shifts to some other semantic spheres
and representational strategies that have been carefully examined in typology but
mostly, if not completely, neglected in neuroscience— namely, events of putting and
taking, serial verb constructions, and verbal classification systems. Lastly, Chapter 5,
“Spatial Relations,” focuses on how people talk about the locations of objects and
actions. It begins by describing how three different kinds of spatial relations— namely,
topological, projective, and deictic— have been studied in great detail in semantic ty-
pology, and then it discusses the surprising fact that, for reasons that remain obscure,
so far only a few sectors of this rich conceptual terrain have been mined by cognitive
neuroscientists.
Scattered throughout the neuroscience sections of these three core chapters, there
are suggestions for new experiments involving various languages. The main purpose
of these proposals is to demonstrate that, when one takes the perspective of semantic
typology, one can formulate novel predictions about the cortical architecture of con-
ceptual knowledge. Some of these experiments could potentially be conducted. But
because others concern languages spoken by small groups of people in remote parts
of the world, it is unlikely that the predictions could ever be tested. In such cases,
5 Both semantic typology and cognitive neuroscience have been making significant headway in the
investigation of abstract concepts, but this book is restricted mainly to concrete concepts, largely in
order to keep the length within reasonable limits. In addition, I should note that although much of the
book is about various conceptual domains, I will refrain from trying to formulate a precise definition
of the term domain, and will instead allow it to remain fairly intuitive, in keeping with current practice
in both semantic typology and cognitive neuroscience. I will also use the terms domain, realm, field,
sphere, and arena more or less interchangeably, as well as the terms conceptual and semantic.

xii Preface
however, the suggestions may still serve as useful thought exercises, since they deal
with theoretically and empirically important, yet hitherto unrecognized, aspects of
the neural representation of concepts— aspects that are most clearly viewed from the
vantage point of typology.
Part III rounds off the book by addressing two questions of a more general na-
ture. Chapter 6, “How Do Language- Specific Concepts Relate to Cognition?,” tackles
the classic issue of whether language affects thought and perception. The following
argument is advanced: many forms of cognition do not necessarily rely on language-
specific concepts; nonetheless, such concepts do sometimes influence a variety of
cognitive processes, as predicted by Whorf’s (1956) linguistic relativity hypothesis.
In addition, this chapter emphasizes the need for more neuroscientific work on this
topic, and it exposes some interpretive challenges facing recent evidence that verbal
and nonverbal semantic tasks often have partly shared cortical underpinnings. Finally,
Chapter 7, “Are We Ever Conscious of Concepts?,” follows Jackendoff (1987, 2012),
Prinz (2012), and several other scholars in defending the counter- intuitive position
that concepts always operate below the surface of awareness. It also shows that, if this
position is right, it raises serious problems for what are now the two most prominent
neuroscientific theories of consciousness— namely, the Global Neuronal Workspace
Theory (Dehaene & Naccache, 2001; Dehaene & Changeux, 2011; Dehaene, 2014;
Dehaene et al., 2014, 2017) and the Integrated Information Theory (Tononi, 2004,
2008, 2012a, 2012b; Oizumi et al., 2014; Tononi & Koch, 2015; Tononi et al., 2016;
Massimini & Tononi, 2018).
Before commencing, some acknowledgments are in order. As I was writing this
book, I benefited greatly from the encouragement of several friends and colleagues,
especially Larry Barsalou, Rutvik Desai, Ed Fox, Ad Foolen, Elaine Francis, and
Brad Mahon. In addition, Asifa Majid and Jamie Reilly were kind enough to read the
whole manuscript and provide valuable feedback— Asifa from the perspective of se-
mantic typology, and Jamie from that of cognitive neuroscience. This led to many
improvements, and I’m very grateful to both of them. Furthermore, Joan Bossert, my
editor at Oxford University Press, has been supportive from the very outset. And fi-
nally, I owe the greatest debt of gratitude to my wonderful wife, Natalya Kaganovich,
who has boosted my spirits during the rough stages of this project, shared my joys
during the smooth ones, and frequently reminded me, with her laughter, kindness,
and companionship, that, amazingly enough, there’s actually much more to life than
wondering about the neural substrates of seemingly exotic languages.

PART I
Two Perspectives
on Concepts

1
THE PERSPECTIVE FROM SEMANTIC TYPOLOGY
I emphasize the range of linguistic variation because that’s the fundamentally interesting
thing about language from a comparative point of view. We are the only known species
whose communication system is profoundly variable in both form and content. . . .
— Stephen Levinson (2003a, p. 29)
INTRODUCTION
The primary purpose of every human language is to convey meaning, and semantic ty-
pology is the branch of linguistic typology that explores how different languages fulfill
this function not only in ways that reflect deep underlying regularities, but also in ways
that are remarkably diverse. This chapter provides a synopsis of this explicitly cross-
linguistic approach to studying concepts, with the aim of giving readers enough back-
ground to understand and appreciate the more detailed typological data covered in
Part II (see also Harrison, 2007; Koptjevskaja- Tamm et al., 2007; Evans, 2010, 2011;
Malt & Majid, 2013; Majid, 2015; Moore et al., 2015; Bohnemeyer, 2019). The first
section focuses on the fact that most people, including cognitive neuroscientists, are
highly susceptible to mistakenly thinking that the concepts conveyed by the words in
their language represent the world in an objective manner that is self- evident and inev-
itable. The next two sections then introduce some basic aspects of semantic typology
by discussing a variety of cross-l inguistic similarities and differences in the encoding
of concepts, first with regard to lexical semantics, and then with regard to grammatical
semantics.
THE APPARENT NATURALNESS
OF ONE’S OWN LANGUAGE
We humans are extremely group- minded creatures. Indeed, some scholars have
argued that our extraordinary success as a species derives primarily from our zoo-
logically unique ability to form complex cultures in which everyone cooperatively
thinks and acts according to certain standards that are not only collectively under-
stood and adopted, but also transmitted across generations, with the consequence that
innovations gradually accumulate through a kind of ratchet effect (Tomasello, 1999,
2014; Richerson & Boyd, 2006; Sterelny, 2012; Richerson & Christiansen, 2013;
Henrich, 2016; Laland, 2017; Boyd, 2018; Heyes, 2018). According to one version
3

4 Concepts in the Brain
of this story, namely Tomasello’s (2014) “shared intentionality hypothesis,” during
late hominin evolution, perhaps around 200,000 years ago, increases in population
size and inter- group competition led to cognitive adaptations for constructing the es-
sential elements of cultural common ground— that is, the practices, customs, attitudes,
institutions, etc., that define a particular society and form the bedrock of its members’
group identity. Examples of such shared knowledge and skills include tool- making
methods, food- sharing rules, religious rituals, and so on. As Tomasello (2014, p. 92)
puts it, “there are collectively accepted perspectives on things (e.g., how we classify
the animals of the forest, how we constitute our governing council) and collectively
known standards for how particular roles in particular cultural practices should be
performed— indeed, must be performed— if one is to be a member of the group.” This
passage highlights the important point that because this group- level or “we” mode of
thinking and acting evolved to promote efficient coordination among the members of
a particular culture, it typically has a normative slant, encouraging people to not only
conform to the traditional lifeways of their community, but also regard those lifeways
as natural and appropriate.
Now, for any given society, cultural common ground consists largely of conceptual
common ground, and conceptual common ground consists largely of word meanings.
After all, word meanings are essentially conventional—i .e., socially sanctioned and
shared— ways of categorizing experiences for communicative purposes, and even
the smallest modern lexicons contain thousands of items (Pawley, 2006). According
to Tomasello (2014), this has tremendous cognitive significance because it implies
that, from early childhood onward, people do not have to invent their own ways of
conceptualizing things; instead, they just have to learn the prepackaged concepts that
are encoded by the words in the local language and that embody, in crystallized form,
the collective intelligence amassed by the entire cultural group over a long period of
historical time (see also Gelman & Roberts, 2017).
Moreover, consistent with the normative nature of the community standards that
hold cultures together, people often develop the intuition that the ready- made and
widely shared words in their language capture inherent, objective, and obvious aspects
of the world. For instance, Malt and Majid (2013) observe that because monolingual
English speakers routinely distinguish between green and blue, cup and glass, slice and
chop, on and in, etc., they tend to think that such familiar, collectively endorsed con-
ceptual distinctions map onto reality in a fairly straightforward and impartial manner.
In the same vein, Wierzbicka (2014, p. 6) notes that “the conviction that the words of
our native language fit the world as it really is, is deeply rooted in the thinking of many
people.” She also shows, however, that the proclivity to treat the meanings of English
words as being “given” by the world is rampant not only among ordinary English
speakers, but also among Anglophone scholars, especially those who have never had
the psychologically disorienting experience of learning a foreign language and thereby
being forced to recognize the cultural contingency of their native language. Such
scholars, including those who study human cognition and behavior, are often una-
ware that although English has both global prestige and a scientific glow, most of its
conventionalized concepts are actually rather parochial, reflecting forms of attention
and strategies of categorization that differ significantly from those exhibited by other
languages. This is exemplified by the fact that, as Wierzbicka (2014) demonstrates,
seemingly natural terms like mouse, table, creek, morning, lunch, teenager, niece, anger,

5 The Perspective from Semantic Typology
kindness, commonsense, privacy, and cooperation have no exact translation equivalents
in many, if not most, of the roughly 6,500 languages scattered around the globe. Even
more strikingly, Evans and Levinson (2009) point out that some languages lack
what most English speakers would consider to be quite elementary and indispen-
sable expressions, such as spatial notions like left of, numerals like seven, and logical
connectives like or.
In the current context, the reason this matters is because it underscores one of the
fundamental ways in which semantic typology can expand the scope of cognitive neu-
roscience and help it overcome its biases and limitations. As mentioned in the Preface,
and in keeping with Wierzbicka’s (2014) remarks about Anglophone scholars in other
fields, it appears that the vast majority of cognitive neuroscientists who study concepts
erroneously presuppose that a substantial proportion of the concepts encoded in
English are self- evident and hence likely to be encoded in other languages as well. As
a result, these researchers tend to assume that the human brain contains a single, al-
beit broadly distributed, conceptual system whose content and design are more or less
the same for everyone everywhere, regardless of what language they happen to speak.
This unwarranted assumption, which is usually tacit, frequently fuels another unwar-
ranted assumption, which is also usually tacit, namely that whenever new discoveries
are made about the neural representation and organization of English word meanings,
they can safely be generalized to other languages. To be sure, a variety of factors do
constrain the cross- linguistic encoding of concepts, and some of them may reflect uni-
versal, perhaps even innate, properties of the brain. But make no mistake: there is also
a huge amount of diversity in the meanings expressed by the thousands of languages
currently spoken on the planet, and this diversity bears directly on cognitive neuro-
science, since it must ultimately be accommodated by any adequate theory of how
concepts are implemented in the brain.
Part II of this book summarizes a number of detailed typological studies of the
cross- linguistic representation of particular conceptual domains, and discusses
how they can contribute to cognitive neuroscience. Here, however, the aim is much
simpler: to convey a general sense of how semantic typology works and what it can
reveal about the nature of concepts. To that end, the next two sections describe some
of the major ways in which languages converge and diverge in the encoding of both
lexical and grammatical aspects of meaning.
LEXICAL SEMANTICS
Loosely speaking, lexical semantics encompasses the meanings of nouns, verbs, and
adjectives, which are usually regarded as the three main “open classes” of words, since
their inventories are often in flux as old items fall into disuse and new ones are created.1
More strictly speaking, however, lexical semantics includes only the grammatically
1 It is worth noting, however, that some languages, like Kalam (Trans- New Guinea, Papua New
Guinea) have very small and fairly fixed inventories of verbs (this is illustrated later in this chapter,
and also in the section on serial verb constructions in Chapter 4). In addition, some languages, like
Kham (Tibeto- Burman, Nepal), only have a few adjectives (Dixon, 2010b), and others, like Lao (Tai
Kadai, Laos), arguably have none at all (Enfield, 2007).

6 Concepts in the Brain
irrelevant conceptual features of these word classes, i.e., the features that do not af-
fect the range of morphological and/o r syntactic constructions that the words can
occur in. This can be clarified by considering the two English nouns book and mud.
Prototypically, the former word has to do with collections of printed, written, or blank
sheets of paper, whereas the latter word has to do with soft, wet, dark earth. These
are the sorts of rich, informative conceptual features that give each word its unique
meaning, and they fall under the rubric of lexical semantics because they have no in-
fluence on the grammatical behavior of the words. It is apparent, however, that the two
words do differ grammatically— for instance, book can easily be pluralized (There are
three books on the porch), whereas mud cannot (*There are three muds on the porch).2 But
this particular difference cannot be traced to any of the conceptual features mentioned
earlier; instead, it derives from the fact that book specifies a type of discrete object,
thereby making it a pluralizable count noun, whereas mud specifies a type of sub-
stance, thereby making it a non- pluralizable mass noun. Because these highly sche-
matic specifications affect the grammatical possibilities of the words, they belong to
the realm of grammatical semantics— a topic addressed further below.
Lexical- semantic idiosyncrasies and universals
As already noted, it is often assumed that languages worldwide have myriad
commonalities regarding the concepts encoded in their lexicons. For instance, Li and
Gleitman (2002, p. 266) begin their paper with the following paragraph:
Language has means for making reference to the objects, relations, properties, and
events that populate our everyday world. It is possible to suppose that these linguistic
categories and structures are more- or- less straightforward mappings from a pre-
existing conceptual space, programmed into our biological nature: humans invent
words that label their concepts. This perspective would begin to account for the fact
that the grammars and lexicons of all languages are broadly similar, despite historical
isolation and cultural disparities among their users.
Lupyan (2016, p. 521) points out that this passage exemplifies a fairly widespread view
(e.g., Pinker, 1994; Bloom, 2002; Clark, 2004; Waxman & Gelman, 2009). Extensive
typological research has shown, however, that such a view is deeply misguided.
Despite the pervasive availability of easy- to- use computer programs that make trans-
lation seem effortless and trivial,3 there is now abundant evidence that most of the
words in any given language do not really have true matches, with identical denota-
tional and connotational ranges, in the vocabularies of other languages (for an author-
itative review, see Malt & Majid, 2013, and for an illuminating literary demonstration,
see Weinberger & Paz, 1987).
2 A qualification: Some people might argue that the sentence There are three muds on the porch can in
fact be felicitous, but I submit that this is only possible under the special “variety” or “kind” construal
of muds, and not under the standard “counting” construal (Langacker, 1987).

7 The Perspective from Semantic Typology
Such exuberant lexical- semantic diversity may seem surprising, but it actually
follows from the fact that every language is the outcome of a massive constraint sat-
isfaction problem for which there are countless possible solutions. On the one hand,
in all domains of experience, such as shapes, movements, and emotions, people can
make innumerable discriminations, any of which could potentially be judged worthy
of conventionalizing with separate words. But on the other hand, every language must
restrict itself to a limited number of labeled categories so as to avoid overwhelming its
speakers’ learning and memory capacities. Thus, the precision of lexical- semantic con-
tent must always be traded off— at least to some degree, and often to a large degree—
against the need for cognitive and communicative efficiency. As a result, there is
immense variation in how different languages end up classifying the vast multidimen-
sional realm of human experiences.4
Examples of idiosyncratic, language-p articular forms of expression are legion
in the semantic typology literature, and also in the rest of this book, so for present
purposes just a few provocative illustrations should suffice. Here is an especially ar-
resting case: Although most languages have a large inventory of verbs, others have a
much smaller stock of them, and this leads to a very peculiar mode of event descrip-
tion. One such language, namely Kalam (Trans- New Guinea, Papua New Guinea),
has only about 130 verb roots, and just 15 of them account for a whopping 89% of all
verb occurrences in texts (Pawley, 1987, 1993, 2008, 2011). In this extremely unusual
system, complex actions are not encoded by individual, semantically specific verbs,
but rather by sequences of generic verbs, as in this rough translation of the English
verb massage:
wyk d ap tan d ap yap g
rub hold come ascend hold come descend do
Turning to a more predictable kind of lexical- semantic variation, some languages de-
velop sizable specialized vocabularies that are devoted to topics of great cultural im-
portance. This is nicely exemplified by Central Yup’ik (Eskimo- Aleut, Alaska), which
has no term corresponding to the English noun boot, but instead has a proliferation of
terms for particular types of boots, as shown in Table 1.1 (Mithun, 2004). In addition,
every language has lots of words with quite distinctive meanings that may seem quite
marvelous when one first encounters them. For instance, Mundari (Austro- Asiatic,
India) has a melifluous term, rawadawa, that refers to “the sensation of realizing that
you can get away with doing something wicked because no one is there to witness
it” (Evans, 2010). Wagiman (Gunwingguan, Australia) has a verb (more precisely, a
coverb), murr, that means “to walk along in the water looking for something with one’s
feet” (Wilson, 1999). Navajo (Athabaskan, Southwestern United States) has separate
names, - yá and - áázh, for “walking alone” and “walking in pairs” (Mithun, 2004). And
Zurich German, but not Standard German, has a term, schärme, that denotes “a place
where it does not rain when it rains all around” (Bickel, 2014).
4 This variation is not, however, completely unlimited, as demonstrated below with regard to color
(see also Kemp et al., 2018).

8 Concepts in the Brain
Table 1.1. Central Yup’ik (Eskimo- Aleut, Alaska) lacks a general term
equivalent to the English noun boot, but it has a large inventory of more
specific terms for particular types of boots.

From Mithun (2004).
Given all this cross-l inguistic diversity, it is natural, of course, to ask whether there
are any genuinely universal lexical- semantic structures (von Fintel & Matthewson,
2008). This continues to be a controversial question, but some researchers believe
the answer is yes. According to the Natural Semantic Metalanguage research program
that Anna Wierzbicka has been directing for over 30 years, all languages do share a
small set of symbolic units that encode the very same basic concepts (e.g., Goddard
& Wierzbicka, 1994, 2002; Wierzbicka, 1996; Goddard, 2008). These concepts
are frequently called semantic primes or atoms because their content is putatively
undecomposable. Approximately 70 such primes have been posited so far, and a large
proportion of them are lexical- semantic rather than grammatical- semantic in char-
acter, falling under such headings as substantives (thing, body), relational substantives
(kind, part), evaluators (good, bad), descriptors (big, small), mental predicates (want,
think, know, feel, see, hear), speech (say, words), events (do, happen, move, touch), and
life and death (live, die). Even some of these apparently incontrovertible candidates for
lexical- semantic universals have been challenged, however. For example, Evans (1994,
2007) argues that there is no counterpart to want in Kayardild (Tangic, Australia)
and that neither think nor know map straightforwardly onto the mental predicates of
Dalabon (Gunwingguan, Australia).
Lexical- semantic fields
In every language, the meanings of most words are defined partly in relation to the
meanings of other words, especially those that fall within the same semantic field. For
example, Levin (1993) sorted over 3,000 English verbs into approximately 50 classes
and 200 subclasses. Representative classes include verbs of contact by impact (e.g., tap,

9 The Perspective from Semantic Typology
poke, pound, swat), verbs of throwing (e.g., toss, fling, hurl, lob), verbs of creation (e.g.,
build, assemble, sculpt, weave), and verbs of ingesting (e.g., eat, chew, gobble, devour).
The verbs in a particular class collectively provide a richly detailed categorization of
the relevant semantic field by making distinctions, sometimes of a remarkably fine-
grained nature, along a number of different parameters. As an illustration, verbs of
destruction are distinguished by the composition of the entity to be destroyed (e.g.,
tear vs. smash), the degree of force (e.g., tear vs. rip), and the extent of deformation
(e.g., tear vs. shred). In addition, the verbs in a particular class are organized according
to principled semantic relations such as the following (Fellbaum, 1998): synonymy,
in which two verbs have nearly identical meanings (e.g., shout and yell); antonymy, in
which two verbs have opposite meanings (e.g., lengthen and shorten); hyponymy, in
which one verb occupies a higher taxonomic level than another (e.g., talk and lecture);
and cohyponymy, in which two verbs occupy the same taxonomic level (e.g., bow and
curtsy). Interestingly, a speaker’s choice of which verb to use in a certain situation may
have social repercussions affecting his or her rights, duties, and accountability. For in-
stance, Enfield (2015a, p. 217) cites a case, originally reported by Sidnell and Barnes
(2013), in which “two children dispute whether one of them had ‘tapped’ an object
or ‘poked’ it, with obvious implications for culpability depending on whose version is
accepted.”
The languages of the world display numerous similarities and differences in how
they lexically subdivide the same semantic fields, and in recent years an increasing
amount of research has been devoted to documenting the extent of this variation,
identifying the factors that drive and constrain it, and determining whether it is sig-
nificantly greater for some fields than others. Comparative studies involving anywhere
from a handful of languages to well over a hundred have already addressed a wide range
of domains, including plants and animals (e.g., Berlin, 1992), body parts (e.g., Enfield
et al., 2006), household containers (e.g., Malt et al., 1999), landscapes (e.g., Burenhult
& Levinson, 2008), colors (e.g., Kay & Maffi, 2005), temperatures (e.g., Koptjevskaja-
Tamm, 2015), odors (Majid & Burenhult, 2014), spatial relations (e.g., Levinson &
Wilkins, 2006a), kinship (e.g., Kemp & Regier, 2012), numbers (e.g., Comrie, 2005),
emotions (e.g., Wierzbicka, 1999), and several categories of action, such as locomoting
(e.g., Slobin et al., 2014), giving (e.g., Newman, 1998), reciprocating (e.g., Evans et al.,
2011), cutting and breaking (e.g., Majid & Bowerman, 2007), putting and taking (e.g.,
Kopecka & Narasimhan, 2012), and eating and drinking (e.g., Newman, 2009). All of
these studies, and many others as well, demonstrate that languages differ multifariously
in their lexical partitioning of the same semantic fields while still tending to exhibit
overarching patterns. Several studies of some of the fields just mentioned are discussed
at length in Part II of this volume, together with pertinent neuroscientific findings. To
get an initial sense here of how such research is conducted, we will briefly consider a
topic that is not covered later— namely, the intensively investigated domain of colors.
Color is a very salient aspect of human visual experience, and the number of shades
that people can perceptually distinguish is enormous—a pproximately two million just
noticeable differences (JNDs). In semantic typology, one of the oldest issues involves
the degree to which languages converge and diverge in their use of basic color terms
to classify this broad spectrum of sensations. To qualify as a basic color term, a word
must be monolexemic and familiar to most speakers, and it must also denote a range
of colors that is not subsumed within the range of a separate term. Some English words

10 Concepts in the Brain
that satisfy these criteria are red, yellow, and purple. Some others that clearly do not
are forward fuchsia, solaria, and euphoric lilac, which are on the flamboyant list of over
1,500 paint colors available from Sherwin- Williams. Because the typological literature
on color is quite large, only a small part of it is summarized here, with special emphasis
on some key methods and results.
Building on classic work by Berlin and Kay (1969), Kay et al. (2009) carried out
the World Color Survey (WCS), which explored the color lexicons of 110 geograph-
ically and genealogically disparate languages from non-i ndustrialized societies. The
stimuli consisted of a standardized array of 330 colored chips representing 40 equally
spaced, maximally saturated Munsell hues at 8 levels of lightness, as well as 10 ach-
romatic shades extending from white to gray to black (Figure 1.1). In each language
community, a fieldworker asked speakers (mean n = 24, range = 6– 30) to not only
name the color of each chip in the grid (a task designed to identify the breadth of each
category), but also indicate which chip best exemplified the meaning of each term (a
task designed to identify the prototype or focus of each category).
The main results reinforced and extended those from Berlin and Kay’s (1969)
previous study. Cross-l inguistically, basic color terms denote three general types of
categories: (1) primary color categories, of which there are precisely six—w hite,
black, red, yellow, green, and blue; (2) composite color categories, which are fuzzy
unions of the primaries— e.g., green/ blue, where “/ ” indicates “or”; and (3) derived
color categories, which are mixtures of the primaries— e.g., pink, which is a mixture of
white and red. In addition, color term systems tend to evolve over historical time in a
manner that proceeds through a succession of increasingly fine- grained partitions of
perceptual color space. In fact, of the 110 languages in the WCS, 91 (83%) have sys-
tems that fall along the central line of development shown in Figure 1.2. For each kind
of system illustrated in this figure, a representative language is mentioned in Table
1.2. These findings reveal several interesting aspects of typological variation and uni-
formity in the lexical encoding of color concepts (see also Haynie & Bowern, 2016).
For instance, there are languages that fail to distinguish between red and yellow, and
there are also languages that fail to distinguish between green and blue, but as a system
develops, the former contrast always emerges before the latter, and this evolutionary
pattern justifies the following implicational universal: if a language distinguishes be-
tween green and blue, then it also distinguishes between red and yellow.

Figure 1.2. A typological and evolutionary scheme covering most of the 110 languages in
the World Color Survey. Letters represent basic color categories according to the following
conventions: W = White; R = Red; Y = Yellow; Bk = Black; G = Green; Bu = Blue. Composite
categories are marked with “/ ”, which means “or.” Each bracketed set of letters represents a type of
color term system, and nine different systems are shown to evolve over five historical stages (marked
I through V), with the system(s) at each successive stage containing one or more term(s) than at
the previous stage, reflecting the progressive differentiation of color space. Derived categories (e.g.,
pink) usually appear after stage V and are not included here because showing all of the possible
combinations would lead to pointless complexity.
From Kay et al. (2009, p. 11).
Statistical analyses of the WCS data have yielded many more insights. Kay and
Regier (2003) compared the centroids— i.e., the centers of mass of the named sets
of chips— of all color categories in all 110 languages, and found that they not only
clustered around certain points in perceptual color space, but did so in a way that
was significantly greater than chance (Figure 1.3; see also Lindsey & Brown, 2006).
