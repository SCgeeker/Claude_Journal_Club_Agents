## 摘要

Perceptual symbol systems assume an analogue relationship between a symbol and its referent, whereas amodal symbol systems assume an arbitrary relationship between a symbol and its referent. According to perceptual symbol theories, the complete representation of an object, called a simulation, should reflect physical characteristics of the object. Amodal theories, in contrast, do not make this prediction. We tested the hypothesis, derived from perceptual symbol theories, that people mentally represent the orientation of an object implied by a verbal description. Orientation (vertical-horizontal) was manipulated by having participants read a sentence that implicitly suggested a particular orientation for an object. Then recognition latencies to pictures of the object in each of the two orientations were measured. Pictures matching the orientation of the object implied by the sentence were responded to faster than pictures that did not match the orientation. This finding is interpreted as offering support for theories positing perceptual symbol systems.

## 核心內容

### 理論背景

A classic debate in cognitive psychology and cognitive science has concerned the format in which information is stored and manipulated in the human brain. The historically prevalent theory has been that of the amodal or propositional symbol system (e.g., Fodor, 1975; Kintsch, 1998). Recently, however, theorists have presented perceptual symbol systems (Barsalou, 1999a, 1999b) as a potentially viable alternative.

### 核心假設

Barsalou (1999b) predicted that if an individual reads a sentence such as "John put the pencil in the cup," then the simulation of that sentence should include a **vertical orientation** for the pencil. However, the simulation of "John put the pencil in the drawer" should include a **horizontal orientation** for the pencil.

### 實驗設計

- **操作變項**: 句子隱含的物體方向（垂直 vs. 水平）
- **依變項**: 圖片辨識反應時間
- **材料**: 24 個實驗項目，105 張黑白線條圖
- **參與者**: 40 名佛羅里達州立大學學生

### 主要發現

Pictures matching the orientation of the object implied by the sentence were responded to faster (M = 838 ms) than pictures that did not match the orientation (M = 882 ms), F(1, 36) = 6.36, p < .05.

### 理論意涵

This finding is interpreted as offering support for theories positing perceptual symbol systems. The results suggest that comprehenders have access to perceptual information during reading, and this has important consequences for research on situation models.

## 方法論筆記

- 使用 Snodgrass and Vanderwart (1980) 的標準化圖片
- 進行前測確保圖片在兩種方向上辨識時間無顯著差異
- 使用 Flags test (Thurstone & Jeffreys, 1956) 作為空間能力共變數
- 刺激間隔 250 ms 以避免參與者形成視角不變的表徵
