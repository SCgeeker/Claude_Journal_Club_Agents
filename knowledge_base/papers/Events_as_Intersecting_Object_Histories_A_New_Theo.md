Events as Intersecting Object Histories: A New Theory of
Event Representation
Gerry T. M. Altmann and Zachary Ekves
UniversityofConnecticut
We offer a new account of event representation based on those aspects of object representation that
encodeanobject’shistory,andwhichconveythedistinctstatesthatanobjecthasexperiencedacross
time—minimallyreflectingthebeforeandafterofwhateverchangestheobjectundergoesasanevent
unfolds.Ourintentionistoaccountforthecontentofeventrepresentations.Foraneventthatcanbe
describedas“thechefchoppedtheonion,”theeventasawholeisdefinedbythechangesinstateand
location, across time, of the onion, the chef, and any instruments that (might have) mediated the
interactionbetweenthechefandtheonion.Thus,wemaintainthateventsareencodedas“ensemblesof
intersectingobjecthistories”inwhichoneormoreobjectschangestate.Ourapproachrequiresnotjust
thedistinctionbetweenobjecttypesandobjecttokens,butalsobetweentokensandtoken-states(e.g.,
between that specific onion and its different states before, during, and after the chopping). These
distinctionsrequireanaccountofhowobjecttokensarerepresentedwithinthecontextofepisodicand
semanticmemory,andhowdistinctobjectstatesareboundintoasingleobjectidentity.Weshallargue
