1 Introduction
In the way of Chao’s (1955) seminal paper on Chinese logical relations, this paper fo-
cuses on how two foundational ontological notions find expression in the Chinese lan-
guage. Ontology in its modern form is the study of how knowledge is organized and
represented in knowledge systems (Prévot et al. 2010). As such, recent studies on
ontology have focused mostly on digital knowledge representation systems, especially
web-based systems. Such studies, however, also involves the knowledge systems of
human language and hence lead to crucial research issues in the interface between
ontology and natural language lexicon and in how languages conventionalize know-
ledge representation systems (OntoLex, Huang et al. 2010a).

One important issue in ontology and OntoLex in particular is whether the onto-
logical conceptual primes are also linguistically expressed. The focus of this study
will be on one of the most fundamental concepts for the knowledge classification:
the endurant/perdurant dichotomy for classification of entities. This concept dichot-
omizes entities according to whether they are dependent on time or not. To para-
phrase the position taken in DOLCE ontology (Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic
and Cognitive Engineering, Gangemi et al. 2010), an endurant, is (the concept of) an
entity that has spatial components but does not depend on a specific time of occur-
rence. In other words, it can exist at any point in time and perceived to be identical
at different temporal locations. A perdurant is (the concept of) an entity which has a
time element crucially associated with its meaning. In other words, to define (the
concept of) a perdurant, we need to take into consideration the variations of its in-
stantiation at different time points. Rigid designators such as people and objects are
the most typical endurants. For instance, Y. R. Chao in 1955 and in 1968 is the same
entity in spite of physical changes. Processes and activities are the most typical per-
durants. A perdurant, such as the process of writing, exists as the sum of different
stages at different times. At any snapshot of time, it is possible to find instantiations
of different aspects of the same process of writing.
As Chinese is a language that has been shown to explicitly encode ontology with its
radical-based writing system (Chou and Huang 2010, Huang et al. 2013b), it is natural
forustoaskwhethertheendurant/perdurantdichotomyisalsorepresentedinChinese.
To answer this question, the classifier system, which marks linguistic classifications
of objects, should be the first system to be examined. In other words, we will
be concerned with the issue of whether the linguistic system of classifiers have
ontological basis. Classifiers are given the grammatical category of Measure (M) in
Determiner-Measure Compound (D-M Compound), a grammatical category specific to
Chinese introducedinY.R.Chao’s(1968)Chinesegrammar.AlthoughweadoptChao’s
term of D-M, we follow subsequent studies (e.g. T'sou 1976, Mo et al. 1996, among
others) in treating D-M as a classifier phrase. It is also important to note that Chao
(1968) listed 9 different M’s, including those measuring activities in a verbal phrase.
ThecurrentstudyfocusesonnounphraseM’sthathavebeentypicallytreatedinChinese
linguistics as part of the linguistic system of classifiers (Aikhenvald 2003). The literature,
however, does vary in how Chao’s M should be further analyzed and whether all sub-
classes of M are in fact classifiers. Li and Thompson (1981) uses classifier as a covering
term to include measure words; while Tai (1994) stipulate that M contains two distinct
categories:classifiersandmeasurewords,andinAReferenceGrammarofChinese(Huang
and Shi 2016),the classifier categorynameis retainedbut differentiatedintotwo distinct
categories: sortal classifiers and measure words (Ahrens and Huang 2016). Many studies
(e.g.Huangetal.黃居仁等1997,HerandHsieh2010)havetriedtoaccountfortheclas-
sifiers/measure words contrast via semantic or syntactic tests without reaching a definite
conclusion.Wiebusch(1995),infact,studiedtheclassificationofChineseclassifiersinre-
lationtotheradicalsystems,underliningtheconceptualbasisofthelinguisticrepresenta-
tionofclassificationinChinese.
The linguistic expression of the classifier system of Mandarin Chinese has two char-
acteristics that make it a valued primary source for ontological studies. First, it is
unique among classifier languages in the world to have classifiers for events and kinds

HuangLinguaSinica (2015) 1:1 Page3of22
in addition to individual objects (e.g. Huang and Ahrens 2003, Huang et al. 黃居仁等
1997). This broad conceptual coverage provides a comprehensive coverage for onto-
logical studies. Second, it has been shown in cognitive studies that the use of classi-
fiers is semantically motivated (e.g. Ahrens 1994) and that there is neurological
evidence for speakers to use classifiers to predict the semantic classes of nouns (e.g.
Chou et al. 2014, Wang and Zhang 2014). Lastly, Huang et al. (1998) demonstrated
thataChinesenounclasssystemcouldbeautomaticallyextractedbasedonthecollocation
of noun and classifiers. In sum, Chinese classifier system has both the conceptual

2 Ontology as knowledge system and the endurant/perdurant dichotomy
2.1Ontologyandknowledgesystem
Ontology studies the system for knowledge representation in terms of basic concepts
and how these concepts are organized in terms of relations, especially in the context of
computational representation (Gruber 1995). With the web becoming the primary
source for information, which causes both the supplyof information and desire for that
information to increase exponentially, the need to directly process the semantics of
web-based content has become urgent (i.e. the semantic turn of the world wide web).
Ontology is the proposed solution to allow computers to process the semantic content
of a web page by explicitly stipulating the knowledge representation system of that web
site(Berners-Leeetal.2001).Giventhateachweb-sitemaypresentdifferentknowledge
systems (hence different ontologies), the construction of a common upper ontology
for all ontological systems then become a foundational task in the study of ontology
(e.g. SUMO, Niles and Pease 2001, DOLCE, Gangemi et al. 2003, and BFO, Smith and
Grenon2004).Andsincehumanbeingsaccessinformationandrepresentknowledgewith
different languages, the interface between lexica as knowledge representation systems for
languagesandontology(Huangetal.2010a),aswellasamongwebcontent,isrepresented
in different languages (Builtelaar and Cimiano 2014). The interface between different
domains and among different languages is among the most challenging issues linking
studiesonlanguageandontology(Bondetal.2014).
2.2Theendurant/perdurantdichotomyastheprimarybifurcationofentities
One of the most fundamental issues in knowledge representation and in providing the-
oreticalfoundation for the construction ofanontologyis thefirstbinary bifurcation for

HuangLinguaSinica (2015) 1:1 Page4of22
entities (i.e. beings that exist, and not limited to referential objects). This is a seemingly
simple decision that will dictate the fundamental design of the knowledge system, that
is, the underlying conceptual or informational criteria for creating different branches in
the knowledge system. Hence, before committing to any structure, builders of upper
ontology (the shared upper parts of ontologies systems) often engage in extensive dis-
cussion in philosophical, logical, linguistic, and cognitive theories before making com-
mitment to this bifurcation (e.g. Guarino 1998, and Guarino and Welty 2002 for
DOLCE, Niles and Pease2001for SUMO, and Grenonand Smith2004for Basis Formal
Ontology (BFO)). Interestingly, many upper ontologies adopt the endurant/perdurant di-
chotomyforthisprimaryclassification,althoughinsomewhatdifferentways.Thisfunda-
mental classification of entities roughly corresponds to what is called continuant and
occurrent inphilosophy (Gangemi et al. 2003, Grenonand Smith 2004).To put it some-
whatsimplistically,anendurantisanentitywhichisfullypresentatanytime;whileaper-
durant is an entity which may have only parts of it present at any specific time, i.e. its
presenceascapturedby‘snapshots’atdifferenttimemayvary,anditsexistenceisdefined
by sum of these ‘snapshots’. Hence the implication is that it is NOT the shape or other
perceivablephysical properties,but ratherthe entity’scontinuityofexistence intimethat
plays a central role in the classification of entities in our knowledge systems. Different
upper ontologies, however, do implement this bifurcation differently. BFO, for instance,
hasastraightforwardbifurcationofcontinuantvs.occurrent,andallowsqualityandother
properties to be subsumed under either type of entities (Grenon and Smith 2004, Smith
andGrenon2004)a.DOLCE,ontheotherhand,applytheendurant/perdurantdichotomy
to entities only (Gangemi et al. 2003), and treats Quality as a separate ontological
categoryb. The expression of endurant/perdurant dichotomy can be illustrated by the
DOLCE upper ontology (adapted from Gangemi et al. 2003, Gangemi et al. 2010) and
given Figure 1 below. A different representation is BFO’s basic bifurcation of continu-
ant/occurrent, as illustrated Figure 2 (adapted from Smith 2012).
Figures 1 and 2 present two alternatives to incorporate the endurant/perdurant di-
chotomy in ontology. BFO’s view is that these are simply two views to represent our
knowledge. If we take a three-dimensional view focused on the continuant, we could
describetheindependent (i.e.referential) partofthe continuantas wellas the dependent
partofthecontinuant(i.e.thedispositionandqualityofthecontinuant).DOLCE,onthe
other hand, restrict the endurant/perdurant classification for entities only, and identifies
qualityasa separateuniquebeginninginontology.Anticipatingthatthe classifiersystem
will involve quality of the entity, we can also compare these two views to see which is
better suited to describe this linguistic system.
Given the prominent role of the time and variation driven endurant vs. perdurant
dichotomy in ontology, it will be interesting to find out if it is expressed in linguistic
systems and how. Intuitively, by the definition of endurant/perdurant and the DOLCE
ontology example, we can see that noun is a part of speech (PoS) which is typically
adopted for endurants; while verbs are typical PoS’s adopted for perdurants. However,
the similarity stops at broad conceptual motivation as most linguistic systems are far
more complex. Thelinkis fairly straightforward forproper nounsasrigiddesignators,
as their references do not change over time. Similarly, the meaning of common nouns,
such as ‘book’ or ‘soldier’, cannot be fully interpreted unless we assume the presence of
thewholeentityatanytimewheretheexistenceofthatentityisconfirmed.‘Abookwith

and the entities can be recognized as ‘the same’as before the loss of their parts because
the conceptual whole may be invoked at any time. Verbs, on the other hand, refer to a
processthatiscarriedoutinadynamicwayovertime.Withenoughtemporalgranularity,
one can see that the presence of an event entity must vary from one time point to the

other. ‘To run, running,’for example, can be envisioned as a series of snapshots where a
foot is on or off the ground, or on an upward or downward trajectory. It is even more
obvious for complex events such as accomplishment and achievement that at any
given time, only part of the full event as entity is present. In other words, the endurant/
perdurantdichotomyseemstoprovide conceptualmotivationbehindthenominal/verbal
dichotomyadoptedinlinguisticsystems.
It is well known, however, that the intuitive nominal/verbal distinction can be easily
blurredwithmanycategorical changedevicesinlanguageaswellaswithatypicalmem-
bers of each PoS: such as event nouns, deverbal nominal, denominal verbs etc. Hence
for the verby/nouny bifurcation, the endurant/perdurant dichotomy seems to be a de-
fault motivation rather than a conceptual must and is not systematically expressed.
Hence, we need to look further for clear evidence of if and how a linguistic system,
such asChinese, expressesthe endurant/perdurant dichotomy.
2.3Chineseasaknowledgesystem:recentstudiesonontologyandChinese
Ontological studies of language and lexicon (e.g. Gangemi et al. 2003, 2010, Pease and
Fellbaum 2010) have focused on the mapping of the linguistic system built on lexical
semantic relations (e.g. hypernym) to the ontological system built on logical relations
(i.e. ISA relation). Although similar studies have been carried out on Chinese (e.g.
Huang et al. 2010b), the fact that Chinese orthography explicitly designate radicals
as semantic primitives provides a new perspective on the possible relation between
language and ontology. It has also previously been demonstrated that Chinese orthog-
raphy is a conventionalized knowledge representation system (Hantology, Chou and
Huang 2010). In addition, Huang et al. 黃居仁等 (2013a) and Huang et al. (2013b)
showed that the ontological system with radicals representing semantic primitives is
driven by Aristotle’s four causes and have the generative power similar to Pustejovs-
ky’s (1995) qualia structure. This is illustrated by Figure 3, adapted from Chou and
Huang (2010).

mapswelltoAristotle’sfourcauses(material,physical,agentive,andtelic)aswellasPuste-
jovsky’s (1995) qualia structure. Huang et al. (2013) takes this argument one step
further when they point out that the Chinese orthography is indeed a knowledge system
organized by radicals which each represent a conceptual primitive but are organized
according to eventive relations similar to the Four Causes or the four qualia. Huang et al.
(2013b) showed that in fact this analysis can be extended to all radicals in Chinese and
that Chinese orthography is indeed a conventionalized knowledge representation
system. This ontological interpretation of the Chinese orthography laid a foundation
for accountsof itsconceptual robustness and representational versatilityas the shared
writing system through historical changes (Chou and Huang 周亞民, 黃居仁 2006)
and for typologically divergent languages (Huang and Chou 2015).
3 Classifiers as an ontological system
3.1TheChineseclassifiersystem
M in a D-M compound (including sortal classifiers and measure words) individuates the
entityrepresentedbyNPtoallowittobequantified.Itdoessobyselectingsomeproper-
ties of that entity as the basis for units of individuation and enumeration Aikhenvald
(2003).
In what follows, I investigate the conceptual basis of the properties selected by M in
order to attempt to differentiate the type of properties selected by different sub-types
of M’s in light of the endurant/perdurant dichotomy. In particular, I look at whether M
selects a time-invariant (endurant) or time-variant (perdurant) property of that entity.

HuangLinguaSinica (2015) 1:1 Page8of22
The current study adopts the sub-categories of classifiers (M) given in Ahrens and
Huang (2016), which largely follow Chao’s (1968) grammar with updates to reflect later
studies on Chinese grammar and classifiers. As seen in Figure 4, classifiers (M’s) are di-
vided into two major categories based on their linguistic behaviors: sortal classifiers
and measure words. Intuitively, sortal classifiers select the semantic class of their head
nouns, while measure words do not have strict selectional preferences. Sortal classifiers
consist of three sub-categories: individual classifiers, event classifiers and kind classifiers.
Measure words also consist of three categories: container measure words, standard
measure words, and temporary measure words.
Note that even though Iuse constructed examples for clear explication,they are con-
structed to be representational of generalizations attested and extracted from the 5
million word version of Sinica Corpus (Chen et al. 1996) and accounted for in Huang
et al. 黃居仁等 (1997). It also important to note individual variation is a hallmark of
humanlanguages(Fillmore et al.1979).Hence it isexpectedthat some speakers mayhave
differences in interpreting or usage of some of the examples presented. It is important to
ensure that such variations are not in conflict with the basic expression of the ontological
bifurcation. In addition, the aim of this paper is not to describe all linguistic variations,
but to capture the systemicity of the expression of the ontological notions, as well as the
robustnessoftheconceptualmotivationofthelinguisticsystem.
3.2Sortalclassifiersdenoteendurantproperties
3.2.1Individualclassifiers
First, as the most typical sortal classifier, individual classifiers typically select common
nouns, which of course are endurant entities. However, the property the classifier
selects depends on the meaning referred to. For instance, 張 zhang as an individual
classifier has multiple senses, and two of the most frequent senses are exemplified
by 一張紙 yi zhang zhi ‘a piece of paper’, and 一張椅子 yi zhang yizi ‘a chair’. 張
Figure4Chineseclassifiersystem(AhrensandHuang2016).

HuangLinguaSinica (2015) 1:1 Page9of22
zhang in 一張紙 yi zhang zhi ‘a piece of paper’ represent the sheet-like property of
paper, which is an endurant property of paper (or any other common noun selected
by 張 zhang). If this type of common noun exists in this form, it cannot lose this
property. Similarly for 一張椅子 yi zhang yizi ‘a chair’, the classifier 張 zhang selects
the endurant property of a flat surface where people can put their body on (e.g. beds
and chairs). Note that this is a telic property defined by the designed purpose, in-
stead of direct description of physical properties of an object. The fact that the prop-
erties denoted by these individual classifiers are time-invariant can be shown in real
world situations where that property seems to be challenged, as in 1a-b below.

1a-b show that the property denoted by individual classifiers endures at all time as long
asthatentityexists,regardlessoftheactualphysicalstateoftheentity.In1a,aslongasan
entity’sexistenceaspaperisconfirmed,itslinguisticexpressionwiththe張zhangclassifier
is notaffectedbyhowtattered and un-sheet-likeitis at acertainspecifictime.Similarfor
the furniture with flat surface 張 zhang in 1b, as long as the existence of the entity is
confirmed, the classifier can be used to express that enduring property regardless of
whethertheobjectiscapableofservingitsfurniturefunctionatthespecifictime.
The individual classifier that is most difficult to analyze is perhaps the generic classi-
fiers 個 ge, as the property it selects is famously difficult to capture precisely. We could
in general describe the property as ‘individualizable’. I.e. 個 ge typically selects common
nouns that can be selected by one of the individual classifiers. In this sense, the classi-
fier denotesa genericendurant property that isthe commonproperty shared bythe set
ofallendurantpropertiesdenotedbyeachindividualclassifier.
3.2.2Kindclassifiers
Thesecondtypeofsortalclassifieriswhatiscalledthekindclassifier(Huangetal.黃居仁
等 1997, Ahrens and Huang 2016). However, the term ‘type classifier’ is probably an even
moreappropriatenameastheydifferfromindividualclassifiersbyselectingtypesinsteadof
tokens(i.e.individuals).Theycoercetypereadingfromthecommonnoun.Thatis,akind/
type classifier denotes a property to select a sub-set of the referents of the common noun
instead of individuals that share that property. For instance, in 2, the kind/type classifier
款kuanselectsamongallsweatersthreeparticularstyles(e.g.bydesignorbybrand).

Thesethree stylesof sweaterare veryfashionablethiswinter.

HuangLinguaSinica (2015) 1:1 Page10of22
Similarly 樣 yang ‘type (CL)’ in3 states that the subjectbought three types ofobjects,
withoutcommittingtothenumbertokensofeachtypec.
(3)他買了三樣東西。
ta__mai__le__san__yang__dongxi
s/he__buy__PERF__three__type(CL)__things
S/hebought threedifferent kindsof stuff.
As mentioned, 款 kuan refers to properties of members of a type sharing the same
style, such as referring to iPhone 6.1. as 這款手機 zhe kuan shouji ‘this model cell-
phone’. Similar to individual classifiers, the type selected share properties that are in-
variant through time. That is, the existence of the type denoted is continuant over
different time. Last, but not the least, similar to the generic individual classifier 個
ge, the generic kind classifier 種 zhong selects a under-specified type that can be
identified in context. In this usage, 種 zhong is the most generic of all classifiers as it
select virtually all common nouns. This is because there are fewer semantic con-
straints on which entities can be referred to as types (that which can be referred to
as individuals).
It is important to note that the use of kind/type classifier must denote time-invariant
enduring properties. For instance, it would be appropriate to use 這一款手機 zhe yi
kuan shouji ‘this model cell-phone’ to refer to iPhone 6, Samsung, android cell phones,
etc. However, it would not be appropriate to use it to denote the sub-set of cell-phones
that are bundled with a service contract. Being bundled with a service contract will
changeovertime andisnot anenduring propertythatisindependentoftime.
For example, even though any product can be sold with a discount (or mark-up) at a
price different from its published price, it is simply infelicitous to use that situation
dependentpricetorefertothatparticulartypeofproduct.Hence,givenattested‘snapshot’

‘the 3,000 dollar model cellphone’. In other words, the kind classifier clearly selects only
time-invariant properties and is incompatible with properties whose instantiation is only

Last, but not the least, please also note that even though D-M compounds with kind
classifiers can receive kind readings, (e.g. such as in ‘Dogs are bigger than cats.’), they

HuangLinguaSinica (2015) 1:1 Page11of22
should be treated simply as a semantic alternation of the construction, rather than as
themeaningofthe classifier.
3.2.3Eventclassifiers
Lastly,theeventclassifierselectseventnouns,whicharenamesusedtorefertoeventsasen-
tities (similar to Chierchia’s account of English gerunds). In gerund usage of ‘Swimming is
fun,’Chierchia(1984)arguedthat‘swimming’referstotheeventinwholeasanentitythatcan
be assigned some constant property, instead of the typical process with time-variant aspects
of instantiations. As such they select entities that are continuant through time. Huang and
Ahrens (2003) argued that in Chinese, such usage is further supported by the existence of
eventclassifiers.Aneventclassifiercaneitherselecteventnouns(suchas會議huiyi‘meeting’
or比賽bisai‘race,competition’)whichdirectlyencodeeventsasentitiesorcoercesreferen-
tial eventive meanings from common nouns. For instance 三場電影 san chang dianying
‘three (scheduled) showings of the movie’ and 兩班公車 liang ban gongche ‘two scheduled
runningofpublicbus’.Thesetwoclassifiers,場chang,and班ban,selecteventnounswhich
arenamesofeventsthatoccuraccordingtoa schedule.班banselectspublictransportation
while 場 chang selects drama-like events (i.e. events which progress according to a script).
These classifiers select event individuals, and allow them to be enumerated. In other words,
onceaneventnounco-occurswithaneventclassifier,itlosesitsmeaningofreferringtothe
events themselves as occurrants. It now refers to the more abstract concept of the existence
of each event as an individual. These individual entities, unlike the actual (non-) occurrence
oftheevent,arenotboundtoanytemporalpoint,suchasin5.

In the two example sentences in 5, I show that event classifier coerce the reading of
event as individuals and hence free from specific temporal reference and eventive in-
stantiation. Hence a 10:49 train for a particular day/morning is always a 10:49 train, re-
gardless of when it arrives, even if it gets cancelled. Similar, each scheduled showing of
a film is treated the same, regardless of how many people see the film or even whether
it was actually shown or not. Since event classifiers refer to the time-invariant aspect of
anevent,theendurant/perdurant contrastcanbeteasedapart,asillustrated by6.

Given an attested flight delay in 6, even with the knowledge of the actual time of tak-
ing off, 6b will be an inappropriate query for the arrival time of the flight. 6a instead is
the appropriate query sentence. This is because the event classifier 班 ban, similar to
individual classifiers, selects a time-invariant property shared by this type of events.
The property 班 ban selects is ‘having the same scheduled time’. For any scheduled
event,thescheduledtimeisanenduring propertythatwillnotbeaffectedbytheactual
event time. In this particular example, the property of having a specific scheduled
departure time of a flight will not change regardless of whether the flight is on time,
delayed, early, or cancelled on a specific date. The actual departure time of a flight,
however, is associated with a specific event instantiation and is not an enduring
property of that flight, and cannot be used to identify that particular type of event.
6b can only be an appropriate query if there is a flight scheduled for 11:23.
The generalization that event classifiers select endurant eventive properties in fact
can supplement the coercion account of event classifiers turning concrete object en-
tities to event entities given in Huang and Ahrens (2003). For example, in 7a-b, as well
as 6, the original meaning of the head nouns refers to the entities of the telephone set
andtherainwaterrespectively.

Huang and Ahrens (2003) argued that the event readings are coerced by the classifier
but didnot explicate how the coercion happened. Based onthe generalization observed
so far, a sortal classifier serves as a linguistic device to express a defining property of a
type of time-invariant entities. To serve this function to conceptualize events as endur-
antentities,themostlikelypropertiesthataneventclassifiercanpickupareproperties
of event structures. For instance, the classifier 通 tong has the original verbal meaning
of ‘connecting, going through’. As an event classifier, it picks up the property of indi-
viduating a single successful connection as the starting point to define a calling event as
an endurant. This can be shared by all telecommunication events and indeed 通 tong is
aneventclassifierforothertelecommunicationeventsincluding電報dianbao‘telegraph’
or even the newly introduced 短訊 duanxun ‘short message, SMS’. Similarly 陣 zhen’s
original meaningreferstoanepisode ofa meteorological events. As anevent classifier, it

HuangLinguaSinica (2015) 1:1 Page13of22
picks up the holisticfeatureofthatepisode from onset to ending aswell asthe shared
feature of a non-volitional ‘happening’. Intuitively, we could view the function of event
classifiersasexpressingthe‘shapesofeventstructure’,asdescribedbyHuangetal.(2000).
To sum up, our discussion showed that event classifier selects a time-invariant prop-
erty. I also showed thatby assuming a sortal classifier must express an ‘enduring’ prop-
erty shared by the entity type, I can predict that event classifiers must refer to ‘shapes
of event structures’ and furthermore, it is this expression of shapes of event structures
that allows event classifiers to coerce event entity reading from nouns denoting con-
creteentities.
3.3Measurewordsdenoteperdurantproperties
3.3.1Standardmeasurewords
Measure words also have three sub-classes. The proto-typical measure word is a stand-
ard measure word, such as 公斤 gongjin ‘kilogram’ in 三公斤肉 san gongjin rou ‘three
kilograms of meat’, which are part of the standard measurement system. The standard
measurement system is a property introduced independent of the entity. It is not a
propertythatisinherentto the entity andindependent oftime. Instead, it refers to per-
durant information, as the measurement is only true at a particular point in time of
thatparticularinstantiationoftheentityandmay varyintime.
(8) 一公斤肉,煮熟後只剩不到600公克
yi__gongjin__rou, zhushou__hou__zhi__sheng__budao__600__gongke
one__kilogram__meat,cooked__after__only__left__less__600__gram
One kilogramofmeatonly weighslessthan 600grams afterbeingcooked.
Example 8 shows that the same entity can take different measurements or measure
words at different times. The fact that standard measure words stand for time-variant
properties can also be illustrated by the fact that an entity can take as many standard
measure words as long as the situation context allows it to be measured by the
standard.
It is important to note, however, although the property denoted by a standard meas-
ure is inherently perdurant (i.e. time-dependent and not linked to any specific inde-
pendent entity), other linguistic devices can be used to coerce an endurant-continuant
readingofanounmodified bya standard measure.
(9) 這一公斤肉,煮成了三道菜
zheyi__gongjin__rou,zhucheng__le__san__dao__cai
this__one__kilogram__meat,cook-make__LE__three__CL__dish
This (piece)ofonekilogrammeatwasmadeintothreedishes.
In 9, the weight of the meat is used to establish the identity of the entity (rather than
providing measurement). Hence it is considered to be an enduring property and used
to refer to the same entity even though, as we know, the weight of the meat after being
cooked has already changed. This interpretation is consistent with the BFO view that
the same entity can be described either in terms of SNAP or SPAN ontology to focus

HuangLinguaSinica (2015) 1:1 Page14of22
on different properties. It is also important to note that the perdurant reading in 8
allows DE-insertion, while the endurant/continuant reading in 9 in is resistant to
DE-insertion. This issue will be explicated in section 3.4.
3.3.2Containermeasurewords
The same can be said of the container measure words as the second type of measure
words. Container measure words, such as 包 bao ‘package,’ 箱 xiang ‘case,’ etc. can in
principle measureany entityas long as thereal world contextallows that entity to be put
insidethatparticularcontainer.Inotherwords,acontainermeasureworddenotesatime-
variant state where the entity is (envisioned to be) contained inside the type of container
specified. The interpretation of the following D-M compounds are situation and context
dependent: 三包糖 san bao tang ‘three packs of sugar’, 三箱糖 san xiang tang ‘three
cartons of sugar’, 三包筆 san bao bi ‘three packs of pens’, 三箱筆 san xiang bi ‘three car-
tonsofpens’.Thereisnowaytoascertaintheactualquantityofobjectsineachcontainer
without explicit knowledge of the particular situations. Like standard measure words,
containermeasurewords’perdurantpropertyisshownbyitshighversatilityinmeasuring
and denoting properties of all types of entities. In addition, the interpretation of the
property(bothof volumeandwayscontained)ofeachcontainerisalsodependentonthe
container or the (partially conventionalized) way of packaging involved in defining the
container. Again, the note on the possibility of borrowing SPAN ontology concept for
descriptionaSNAPontology,discussedinthelastsectiononmeasurewords,alsoapplies
here. In other words, when required by real world context, the language does allow a
speaker to select a perdurant property described by a container classifier to treat it as an
endurant.
3.3.3Temporarymeasurewords
Lastly, temporary measure words are often called ‘pseudo-classifiers’ they typically only
take the numeral 一 yi ‘one’ (Chao 1968). There are two sub-types of temporary meas-
ure words. The first is derived from a familiar cognate concrete common noun (with
body partsbeingsome themoreprominent ones),asin(10).
(10)a. 一/滿身(的)灰
yi/man__shen__(de)__hui
one/full__body__(DE)__dust
abody-ful ofdust
b.一/滿屋子(的)灰
yi/man__wuzi__(de)__hui
one/full__room__(DE)__dust
aroomful ofdust
10 describes a result state where the existence of certain entity is prevalent at a cer-
tain location. Here a container metaphor is invoked to describe the result state, with
the filled-inlocationbeingused asthe temporary measure word. The situation describe
occurs at a specific time-location and is not enduring for either the entity or the meas-
ure word. When used as an object, it refers to the extent of a result state, as in 11,
again underlining theperdurantproperty.

(11) 汽車濺了他一身的水
qiche__jian__le__ta__yi__shen__de__shui

Another sub-type of temporary measure words involve denoting the prevalence of
certainmentalactivities,asin12:

In 12, the temporary measure word denotes the extent of mental state. This is again
atime-specificoccurrentandthus,aperdurantproperty.
3.4Linguisticexpressionofontologicalnotions
3.4.1ThecorrelationbetweenDE-insertionandperdurantproperties
Interestingly, the endurant/perdurant contrast observed above corresponds to the
morphosyntactic behavior of DE-insertion between the D-M compound and
the NP it modifies. This, in fact, leads to the common practice in the field of
Chinese linguistics to use the lack of potential for DE-insertion as a litmus test for
classifiers (Huang et al. 黃居仁等 1997, Her and Hsieh 2010, Ahrens and Huang
2016).

There is a clear contrast between endurant M, i.e. sortal classifiers in 13, and perdur-
ant M. i.e. measure words in 14, which demonstrate that DE-insertion is allowed only
when the M selects perdurant properties and that in general, DE-insertion does not
changethemeaningofperdurantD-Mcompounds.
3.4.2WhenDE-insertionappliestosortalclassisifers
This generalization in fact can be extended to even seeming exceptions with when DE-
insertion occurs with sortal classifiers, as the examples in 15 allow perdurant readings
only.
(15) a. 一百回的水滸傳

b. 一百二十回的水滸傳

one-hundred-and-twenty__chapter__DE__Water-Margin
theone hundred andtwentychapteredition ofWaterMargin
回 hui in15 is infact an event classifier for literaryworks, referring to both scenes in
play and chapters in classical vernacular novels (which typically originated from 評書
pingshu ‘oral storytelling’). As a sortal classifier, it should not allow DE-insertion. In 15,
with DE-insertion, the interpretation is, in fact, perdurant. That is, instead of the enu-
merating function of a typical D-M compound, 15a and 15b are used to differentiate
distinct editions of Water Margin, which is known to have multiple editions containing
different numbers of chapters. In other words, 水滸傳 shuihuzhuan ‘Water Margin’
here is not longer a single time-invariant entity, it is now viewed as a collection of
endurant entities (i.e. each different edition of Water Margin is considered a separate
entity). These entities are, however, differentiated by the situation specific property of
thenumberofchapters they contain.
Similarly, in 16a and 16b, the examples involving internal modification of individual
classifiersunexpectedly allow DE-insertion.A small setofadjectivesisallowed tooccur
before sortal classifiers to describe the situation specific properties of the entity (paper
in our examples). In such usages, the property the classifiers denote becomes time-
specific and perdurant. And linguistically this is clearly marked by the allowance of
DE-insertion. In addition, comparing 16c-d with 16a-b underlines the assignment of
perdurant properties.

16c, d shows that it is possible to have these adjectives directly modify the common
noun.However,insuchusages,itfollowsthetypicalindividualclassifiersfornotallowing
DE-insertion. In other words, the direct modification of the entity does not change the
endurantpropertyoftheentity.Thiscontrastnicelyillustratethatthelinguisticexpression
of byDE-insertion infactmarks theperdurantpropertyoftheD-Mcompounds. Insum,
seeming exceptions of sortal classifiers allowing DE-insertion are instances where the
DE-insertion coerces a perdurant reading. Hence, I have showed that de–insertion is
allowed in D-M construction when M selects perdurant properties of the entity it
modifies. This generalization about the semantic function of DE-insertion is consistent
withanotherobservationmadebyChao(1968)between白花油baihuayou‘PakFahYeow’
白花的油baihuadeyou‘a(n)(essential)oilmadefromawhiteflower,’asillustratedin17.

b. 白花的油

Example 17 shows that 白花油 baihuayou ‘Pak FahYeow’, a proper name for a prod-
uct with time-invariant referent, does not allow DE-insertion, while 白花的油 baihua
de you ‘a(n) (essential) oil made from a white flower’, which refers to time-variant refer-
ent depending on which kind of flower is used to produce the (essential) oil on each
occasion, must be used with 的 de ‘DE’ inserted. Following the generalization obtained
so far, we can account for this contrast observed in Chao (1968) by hypothesizing that
the insertion of 的 de ‘DE’ in a compound or noun phrase requires a time-variant/
perdurant interpretation of the pre-head element.

HuangLinguaSinica (2015) 1:1 Page18of22
3.4.3DoesDE-insertionmarktime-variantproperty?
的 de ‘DE’, as the most frequent word and character in Chinese, accounts for up to 5%
of word frequency in a corpus (e.g. Chen et al. 1996), and remains one of the most
challenging function words to be accounted for in Chinese. Contrary to pervasive lit-
erature in Chinese linguistics, following Zhu 朱德熙 (1961), trying to differentiate a
range of different functions and meaning of 的 de ‘DE’, Huang (1987) argued that all 的
de ‘DE’ in Chinese has one single syntactic function: to mark the unit following it as
syntactic head. In addition, Huang 黃居仁 (2013) suggested that such head marking
functions could be treated as a construction. Based on the occurrence of DE-insertion
with D-M phrases, and supported by examples involving other compounds, it seem
that perhaps 的 de ‘DE’ may have a single uniform function of marking the property
denoted by preceding element as time-variant and perdurant. Thisseems to be a plaus-
ible account given the emergent account that all relative clauses, marked by 的 de ‘DE’
before its head noun, are all restrictive (Shi 2016). It seems that the different accounts
attempting to give a uniform linguistic function to 的 de ‘DE’can in fact be unified by
the conceptual motivation that 的 de ‘DE’ is a linguistic expression of the ontological
notion of perdurant in Chinese. That is, the phrase before de introduces time or situ-
ation dependent property, which intersects with the endurant and/or perdurant entity
representedbythehead nountoestablishamorerestrictive meaning.
Thisontologicalmeaningisalsoconsistentwiththetype-shifting formalaccountpro-
posed in Huang (1987) where de introduces type-shifting and will look for a situation
specific (in the temporal-locational-event continuum) variable to bind to the preceding
clause, as illustrated in 18 where the most typical ‘light’ head nouns to follow de are in
fact time, situation and location (adopted from Huang 黃居仁 2013). In 18a-c, for ex-
ample, the element preceding 的 de ‘DE’ each denotes a specific situation, which then
intersects with the ‘light’ head noun indicating a situationtype that stipulates aparticu-
lartime-variant situation.

A full account of the all Chinese expressions involving 的 de ‘DE’ is clearly beyond
the scope ofthe current paper. However, based onontologicalinterpretations discussed
in this paper, there are two possible interpretations. The first, consistent with the upper
ontology design of DOLCE, is that the insertion of 的 de ‘DE’ marks the preceding
elementasdenoting perdurant properties. Thesecond, consistent with thetreatmentof

HuangLinguaSinica (2015) 1:1 Page19of22
continuant/occurrent contrast of BFO, is that the insertion of 的 de ‘DE’ marks the
shift to a SPAN (i.e. four-dimensional spatiotemporal) ontological view, and hence
underlines time-dependent properties. Either ontological account will have important
implications for explanatory accounts of Chinese grammar.
4 Conclusion
I have shown in this paper that the Chinese classifier system offers robust linguistic ex-
pression of the ontological notions of endurant vs. perdurant. In particular, the dichot-
omy is encoded with the sortal classifier vs. measure words sub-systems of the Chinese
classifiers. In addition, I have also shown that DE-insertion in D-M compounds is an
explicit and reliable mark to underline time-variant properties, either marking the shift
to a SPAN ontological view or to directly mark the preceding property as endurant. I
haveshownthatDE-insertionnotonlyappliestoall D-Mcompoundsinvolvingmeasure
words(whichdenotesperdurantproperties),butalsotospecificsortalclassifierconstruc-
tions where a time-variant meaning is coerced. I have also given additional examples to
showthatthemarkingofperdurantproperties/SPANontologicalviewmaybeasemantic
featureofmanyde-constructionsinChinese.Takingthisintoconsiderationinadditionto
the intuitive nouny/verby categorical dichotomy, I claim that ontological notions do find
linguisticexpressioninChinese,similartowhatChao(1955)foundwhenlookingfor the
linguisticexpressionoflogicalrelationsinChinese.
In addition to potential extension of a unified conceptual account of 的 de ‘DE’ in
Chinese, our study of the expression of endurant/perdurant ontological dichotomy in
Chinese has implications for future studies on the relation between ontology and lan-
guage as knowledge systems. For instance, event and kinds as endurant individuals are
not specifiedinthe currentversionofupperontologyofBFO,DOLCE(aswellasmany
other competing ontologies), and it remains open for further research to determine if
the evidence from Chinese classifiers requires the addition of such nodes. Moreover, as
the classifier system involves both description and measurement of different qualities, a
full explanatory account of the system must address the interaction between entity and
quality. For example, further work needs to be done to determine if such qualities are
better treated independently of entities (i.e. the DOCLE approach) or as dependent on
entities in order to allow shift of ontological views (i.e. the BFO approach). This is a
fundamental ontological decision and I hope that further exploration of the linguistic
expressionsofontologyinChinesewillshedlight onthis importantissue.
Last but not the least, as mentioned earlier, the standard position of current studies
on ontology is that the formal ontology is the rigorous and logically robust system
which is the shared foundation of knowledge representation through either domain
specific (and potentially inconsistent) local ontologies, as well as less rigorous and po-
tentiallyconflictinglanguagespecificontologies.Howeve
