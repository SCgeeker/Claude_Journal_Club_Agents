A body of studies in alphabetic languages has shown that perceptual representations
can be reactivated in language comprehension; this is a phenomenon known as per-
ceptual simulation (Engelen et al., 2011; Louwerse et al., 2015; Zwaan et al., 2002). For
example, when reading the sentences ‘Laura saw the hawk in the nest’ and ‘Laura saw
the hawk in the sky’, the distinctive images of a hawk will be referred to. The former
sentence activates the image of a hawk with wings folded, whereas the latter one
should activate the image of a hawk with wings outstretched. According to theories
of embodied cognition, perceptual simulation in language comprehension occurs
because conceptual knowledge acquired through sensorimotor experiences can gener-
ate corresponding sensorimotor representations and be stored in an embodied system
(Barsalou et al., 2008; Louwerse, 2018). However, previous studies of perceptual

simulation have not fully integrated findings from children, especially in non-alpha-
betic languages, such as Chinese (Li et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2005).
In addition to the representations from the embodied system, representations from
a linguistic system (e.g., orthographic and semantic) can be reactivated to facilitate
language processing (Louwerse, 2018). Although perceptual representations of con-
cepts can be activated automatically in language comprehension, it is not always
necessary to reactivate them to their full extent (Dijkstra et al., 2004; Louwerse et al.,
2015). Considering that these two systems are independent but connected (Mahon,
2015), the extent of the activation of perceptual representations (e.g., perceptual simu-
lation) might be influenced by children’s literacy abilities, which correlate intimately
with the linguistic representations (Perfetti et al., 2005). However, the relationship
between perceptual simulation and literacy ability in children is inconclusive, based on
mixed findings from previous work (e.g., Engelen et al., 2011; Tabiee et al., 2021).
Moreover, as a critical approach to acquiring these perceptual features of concepts,
body-object interaction (BOI; Siakaluk et al., 2008) was not controlled in previous stud-
ies. To address these issues, the current study investigated perceptual simulation in
language comprehension in Chinese children, with the BOI controlled. Meanwhile, as
an efficient indicator of Chinese children’s general literacy abilities (Ho et al., 2017),
reading ability at the word level, i.e., Chinese character reading was measured to
examine the relationship between perceptual simulation and literacy ability.
Perceptual simulation in language comprehension
Perceptual simulation in adults has been demonstrated in studies using a perceptual
mismatch paradigm across languages (e.g., Dijkstra et al., 2004; Li et al., 2007;
Stanfield & Zwaan, 2001). Typically, in the perceptual mismatch paradigm, participants
are asked to read and/or listen to a sentence that describes an object in a situation
(e.g., Laura saw the hawk in the nest). Then, they are asked to respond whether the
object in a subsequent picture was mentioned in the preceding sentence. The picture
is either perceptually (e.g., shape or orientation of the object) matched (e.g., a hawk
with wings folded) or mismatched (a hawk with wings outstretched) with the situation
implied by the preceding sentence. Although with different perceptual features, the
picture in either of the two conditions depicts the object (e.g., the hawk) in the sen-
tence. Thus, the correct response to the respective pictures in these two conditions
should be ‘yes’.
If processing the sentence will activate specific perceptual representations that are
consistent with the situation, a difference in responding to sentence-picture pairs in
the two conditions should be observed as the activated perceptual representation
should be congruent with the picture in the perceptually matching condition, but not
in the perceptually mismatching one (Zwaan et al., 2002). In line with this assumption,
a mismatch effect, i.e., participants taking less time to correctly verify the perceptually
matching pictures compared with the perceptually mismatching ones, has been
reported in studies of different sensorimotor aspects, such as shape (Zwaan et al.,
2002), size (de Koning et al., 2017), colour (Zwaan & Pecher, 2012), orientation

EDUCATIONALPSYCHOLOGY 589
(Stanfield & Zwaan, 2001), and movement (Glenberg & Kaschak, 2002) during language
comprehension.
The mismatch effect reflects the extent of the perceptual simulation: a larger
mismatch effect indicates more reactivation of perceptual representations of con-
cepts in language processing, e.g., reading and/or listening to sentences (Louwerse
et al., 2015; Zwaan et al., 2002). Neuroimaging studies found that the same sensori-
motor modalities (e.g., visual and motor) relating to experiences for concepts, e.g.,
interacting with the actual object, can be activated during processing the concepts
(Binder & Desai, 2011; Sakreida et al., 2013). These findings about the perceptual
simulation support that conceptual knowledge can be gained from sensorimotor
experiences, which can produce corresponding sensorimotor representations and be
stored into long-term memory. In turn, these sensorimotor experiences can be reac-
tivated later to facilitate cognitive processes (e.g., reading) relating to the concept
(Barsalou et al., 2008).
The mismatch effect in children has been revealed in languages such as
English (Engelen et al., 2011), Dutch (de Koning et al., 2017), and German (Hauf,
et al., 2020; Seger et al., 2020), suggesting that once children have accumulated
enough sensorimotor experiences, the perceptual representation will be involved
in language processing (Engelen et al., 2011). However, studies of perceptual
simulation in children are still scant in the Chinese language. Similar to in alpha-
betic languages, in the Chinese language, conceptual knowledge can be acquired
from sensorimotor modalities through an individual’s interactions with referents in
the world (Barsalou, et al., 2008). Furthermore, in the Chinese language, in add-
ition to concrete concepts, abstract concepts can be expressed by concrete
objects/events (Yu, 1995). For example, 手足/sau2 zuk1/uses the concepts 手
(hand) and 足 (foot) to express the meaning of sibling. The concepts regarding
taste 辛/san1/(spice) and 苦/fu2/(bit) are compounded to become the word 辛苦
(exhausting). Although the current study focussed on the perceptual simulation of
concrete concepts, such a characteristic of the Chinese language leads to a strong
connection between sensorimotor experiences and meanings of concepts (Yu,
2002). Thus, it is reasonable to assume the existence of perceptual simulation in
Chinese children.
On the other hand, concepts have differences in terms of BOI, which is an
important method for obtaining sensorimotor experiences (Siakaluk et al., 2008).
Using the BOI ratings of words, i.e., the ease with which a human body can inter-
act physically with a word’s referent in daily life, earlier studies found that readers
could recognise words representing objects with high BOI ratings faster than those
with low ratings (Bennett et al., 2011; Siakaluk et al., 2008). In general, objects that
are used in tasks with the perceptual mismatch paradigm (e.g., Engelen et al.,
2011; Seger et al., 2020) have different magnitudes concerning the BOI. For
example, children may have more bodily interactions with eggs than with eagles.
The BOI ratings of concepts may influence the perceptual simulation, however, this
was rarely taken into account in the previous studies. Hence, the current study
modified the perceptual mismatch paradigm by considering the BOI rating of

590 Z.XUANDD.LIU
experimental stimuli to investigate perceptual simulation in language comprehen-
sion in a stricter way.
Perceptual simulation and literacy ability
The symbol interdependency hypothesis (Louwerse, 2018) suggests that the concept-
related representations from both the linguistic and embodied systems are activated
automatically during comprehension. In language processing, these two systems can
be activated at the beginning, and the linguistic system peaks before the embodied
system does. Both of these systems can facilitate language comprehension (Mahon,
2015). The former system relates to linguistic/literacy knowledge (e.g., metalinguistic
knowledge), while the latter focuses on representations acquired from sensorimotor
experiences (Louwerse, 2018). These two systems may also interplay with each other.
Specifically, the sensorimotor representation contributes to the construction of con-
cepts’ meanings (Barsalou et al., 2008), which is related to the semantic constituent of
word representations (Griffiths et al., 2007). Considering that semantic constituent
plays a critical role in developing literacy abilities (Perfetti et al., 2005), there might be
a relationship between perceptual simulation and literacy ability in children.
A few developmental studies have investigated this relationship; however, their
findings were mixed. A study in English-speaking children (aged 7–10; Engelen et al.,
2011) reported similar mismatch effects between children with distinctive reading per-
formances. The study treated the children with scores of 56 or higher in the word
reading task as individuals with better literacy abilities, and others as individuals with
poorer literacy abilities. This dichotomy minimised the variance of literacy perform-
ance, which may have been a reason for their result. Moreover, the study did not con-
trol age, which can influence children’s literacy abilities (Perfetti et al., 2005) and the
accumulation of perceptual experiences (Smith & Gasser, 2005).
In contrast, a recent study with Iranian children (Tabiee et al., 2021) found that,
compared to age-matched typically developing children, smaller mismatch effects
were observed in children with dyslexia (aged 8–13years), who had a poorer literacy
performance. This finding lent support for a relationship between perceptual simula-
tion and literacy ability. However, this finding might be elicited by perceptual deficien-
cies in the children with dyslexia, rather than the distinctive literacy abilities of these
two groups. It should be noted that, in addition to reading difficulties, children with
dyslexia generally have problems in perceptual (e.g., visual) processing (Bosse et al.,
2007), which may impair the acquisition of sensorimotor experiences and the construc-
tion of perceptual representations. Thus, it is possible that the relationship between
perceptual simulation and literacy ability in typically developing children without per-
ceptual deficits, which was investigated in the current study, would be different from
that found by Tabiee et al. (2021). Such a study could also help us to understand liter-
acy development better, particularly since perceptual simulation has not been consid-
ered well previously in this area.
According to our understanding, there should be at least two possibilities for the
relationship between perceptual simulation and literacy development in Chinese chil-
dren. One is that larger mismatch effects will be observed in children with more

EDUCATIONALPSYCHOLOGY 591
developed literacy abilities (i.e., skilled readers). This possibility is related to the
assumption that skilled readers are supposed to have more linguistic knowledge
(Perfetti et al., 2005), which can facilitate the connection between linguistic representa-
tions and corresponding perceptual representations (Smith & Gasser, 2005).
Accordingly, more connections could make it easier for skilled readers to reactivate
perceptual representations during language processing than it is for those with less
developed reading abilities (i.e., less skilled readers).
Another possibility is the opposite, that skilled readers will have smaller mismatch
effects than less skilled readers. The reactivation of perceptual representations can
facilitate understanding, but it is not always necessary to reactivate them to their full
extent for language processing (Louwerse et al., 2015). Consistent with this assump-
tion, a study with English adults (Dijkstra, et al., 2004) found that younger adults
(mean age ¼ 18.25) had an overall higher accuracy rate and response speed in a lan-
guage comprehension task with the perceptual mismatch paradigm than older adults
(mean age ¼ 74.40) did. However, smaller mismatch effects were observed in the
younger group. It is possible that the magnitude of reactivated perceptual representa-
tions will be smaller if readers have enough linguistic representations for completing a
reading task. In contrast, since less skilled readers have less linguistic knowledge to
comprehend efficiently, they may reactivate more perceptual representations to facili-
tate processing.
The present study
In summary, the current study investigated two research questions: (1) whether the
perceptual simulation in language comprehension would be present in Chinese chil-
dren; and (2) whether the perceptual simulation would be influenced by the children’s
literacy ability. The current study was conducted in Hong Kong, where the first stage
of literacy acquisition is from Grades 1 to 3. During the first stage of literacy acquisi-
tion, children are supposed to acquire 65% (i.e., 2,169) of the new characters that they
should learn in primary school (Education Bureau, 2007). Given fairly well-developed
literacy abilities, with accumulated sensorimotor experiences (Carlisle, 2000; Wellsby &
Pexman, 2014), the end of the first stage of literacy acquisition, i.e., Grade 3, would be
a good point to start the investigation of the relationship between perceptual simula-
tion and reading ability in Chinese.
A sentence-picture verification (SPV) task (Engelen et al., 2011) was adopted to
measure children’s perceptual simulation, and the mismatch effect was used as an
indicator of perceptual simulation. In Chinese, reading ability at the word level, i.e.,
Chinese character reading, has strong correlations with other literacy outcomes such
as reading fluency and reading comprehension (Ho et al., 2017). It was adopted as an
indicator to represent children’s general literacy performances. To gain a relatively
comprehensive understanding, Chinese character reading was measured twice, with a
one-year interval. That is, both the concurrent literacy ability (i.e., Grade 3) and that of
one year before (i.e., Grade 2) were measured to examine possible relationships
between perceptual simulation and literacy ability. The one-year earlier data could be
obtained because the data for the present study were from a two-year longitudinal

592 Z.XUANDD.LIU
dataset, while the mismatch task was only administered in Grade 3. Control factors
were the participant’s age, gender, nonverbal intelligence, and working memory, as
well as the word frequency and BOI ratings of experimental words and pictures in the
SPV task, which may impact upon perceptual simulation and its relationship with read-
ing ability (Cain, 2006; Chiu & McBride-Chang, 2006; Wellsby & Pexman, 2014).
Nonverbal intelligence was measured at Grade 2 in the current study as it can predict
later reading performance (Ritchie et al., 2015). The testing time for each occasion was
around 40min.
Method
Participants
Ninety-six children were recruited from two public primary schools in Hong Kong, and
written informed parental consent was obtained for all participants. All data from
three participants were excluded because two of them had overall accuracy lower
than 60% on the SPV task; while the other one had low scores on Chinese character
reading for both occasions (i.e., three standard deviations below the participants’ aver-
age score). The remaining 93 participants (45 girls) were native speakers of Cantonese,
and had no physical or mental problems regarding visual, linguistic, or developmental
aspects, according to their teachers and parents. Their mean ages were 8years and
0.43months (SD¼4.09months) on the first occasion and 9years (SD¼4.07months) on
the second occasion. In addition, another 30 third graders were recruited to rate the
BOI for the experiment pictures and words (i.e., the words of the corresponding
objects in the experiment sentences) on the second occasion. These 30 children were
not given any of the other measures used in the study.
Procedure
Data were collected from two-time points. Nonverbal intelligence was measured on
the first occasion (i.e., Grade 2), while perceptual simulation and working memory
were examined on the second (i.e., Grade 3). The task for literacy ability, i.e., Chinese
character reading, was conducted on both occasions.
Measures
Chinese character reading
A Chinese character reading task (Liu et al., 2017) was used to examine reading ability
at the word level, which was used to represent general literacy ability. In this task, the
children were required to read three-character lists aloud, one by one. Each list con-
tained 72 characters, and the three lists were specific to Grades 1, 2, and 3 in primary
school. To measure literacy ability at a more comprehensive level, these lists were con-
structed by considering compound/noncompound characters, character frequency,
family size, and family frequency (i.e., the average frequencies of all words with a
given morpheme; Da, 2004). Each list consisted of 16 regular compound characters
(i.e., pronounced the same/similar as the phonetic in isolation, such as 像/zoeng6/

EDUCATIONALPSYCHOLOGY 593
(like)), 32 irregular compound characters (i.e., those having a completely different pro-
nunciation from the phonetic, such as 活/wut6/(life), where the phonetic 舌 is pro-
nounced as/sit6/(tongue)), 12 simple noncompound characters, such as 在/zoi6/(in),
and 12 complex noncompound characters, such as 真/zan1/(true). The characters in
each list were ordered by their rankings in 3,500 frequent Chinese characters (Cai &
Brysbaert, 2010), and the test stopped when a child failed to recognise 15 consecutive
characters. The average rankings of characters in the three lists were 1,045.6 (range
from 6 to 2,723), 1,103.9 (range from 10 to 3,053), and 1,323.9 (range from 6 to 3,457).
One point was given for each correct answer, and thus the maximum score was 216.
The same Chinese character reading task was adopted on both occasions. The
Cronbach’s alphas were .98 and .95 for the first and second occasions, respectively.
Sentence-picture verification task
The SPV task (Engelen et al., 2011) was used to measure perceptual simulation.
Twenty-four objects familiar to children (e.g., cat and pen) were selected. Then, 24
experimental sentence pairs were constructed, each of which implied a distinct
shape of the same object, for example, ‘果園裡種著西瓜, a watermelon in a garden’
and ‘果盤裡放著西瓜, a watermelon on a fruit plate’. In the former sentence, the per-
ceptual matching image was the whole watermelon; in the latter, it was pieces of
watermelon. All the sentences were developed with characters selected from the first
part (i.e., Grades 1–3) of Hong Kong Chinese lexical lists for primary learning (Education
Bureau, 2007) to ensure there were no new characters in these sentences. As well, 24
picture pairs corresponding to the experimental sentence pairs were developed, and
24 filler sentences were constructed, all of which were paired with unrelated pictures.
All pictures were black-and-white (see Appendix A), drawn by an undergraduate Visual
Arts student.
At the same time, the BOI of the experimental words and pictures were rated by 30
students in Grade 3, who were not involved in any of the tasks in the present study
on the second occasion. These children were asked to rate, on a 1–7 scale, how easily
they could interact physically with each word’s referent; a rating of 1 was extremely
easy, and 7 was extremely difficult. For example, it is relatively easy for a child to have
a bodily interaction with a desk, whereas it is more difficult to have one with a tiger.
Each of the 30 students was asked to give two examples of objects, one with a rela-
tively high BOI rating and the other relatively low, to ensure the child understood the
instruction about rating. The average BOI rating was 4.37 (ranging from 1.19 to 7) for
the pictures and 4.72 (ranging from 1.28 to 6.93) for the words.
To control the combinations of sentences and pictures, we developed four versions
of the task, which were counterbalanced among the participants. Each experimental
sentence was presented with the perceptual matching picture in one version, but with
the perceptual mismatching picture in the other version. For each version, the trials
started with the presentation of a fixation cross at the centre of the screen for 250ms,
with a ‘beep’ sound (250Hz) to remind the participant that the test was about to start.
After a blank screen for 1,000ms, a written sentence appeared at the centre of the
screen for 3,000ms. Simultaneously, the corresponding audio of the sentence was pre-
sented via a headphone. All of the audio (16-bit stereo, 22,050Hz) was recorded in a

sound-attenuated room by a female native speaker of Cantonese. The mean duration
of the auditory files was 2,462.33ms (SD¼224.82), ranging from 2,086ms to 3,000ms.
The participants were asked to read and listen to the sentence, and the audio could
assist their comprehension if there were any new characters. Then, one picture
appeared in the centre of the screen after another blank screen for 1,000ms. After the
participants responded whether the depicted object was mentioned in the preceding
sentence (‘F’ referred to yes; ‘J’ referred to no), a blank screen was replaced by the
next trial after 2,000ms. The participants were encouraged to respond as quickly and
accurately as possible. The participants began with 10 practice trials consisting of 5
related and 5 unrelated pictures. Next, they completed a sequence of 48 trials, of
which 24 were experimental. Each participant performed 12 matching and 12 mis-
matching trials, all requiring affirmative responses. In addition, 24 trials were requiring
negative responses. The trials were presented in random order. The experiment took
approximately 15min to complete. The experimental procedure is illustrated in Figure
1. The Cronbach’s alphas of the response times were .75 (perceptually matching condi-
tion) and .71 (perceptually mismatching condition).
Raven’s standard progressive matrices
Nonverbal intelligence was measured by Sets B and C of the Raven’s Standard
Progressive Matrices (Raven, 2000). There were 24 items, and the maximum score was
24 points. For each item, the children were asked to identify the missing element
from six or eight choices according to the corresponding pattern. The Cronbach’s
alpha was .78.

Backward digit recall
A backward digit recall task (Alloway & Alloway, 2010) was adopted to measure work-
ing memory. That is, the children were asked to recall 14 strings of Arabic digits (e.g.,
6-7-3) in the reverse order (e.g., 3-7-6) after listening to each string. The digit strings
ranged from two to eight digits long and were arranged in order of increasing length.
One score was assigned to each correct answer, with a maximum of 14. The
Cronbach’s alpha was .89.
Data analysis
Linear mixed models (LMMs), in which all random factors (i.e., individual differences in
participants and stimuli) could be considered simultaneously with fixed effects of inter-
ests, were utilised to investigate the perceptual simulation and its relationship with lit-
eracy ability. The lme4 package and the lmerTest package (Kuznetsova et al., 2017) in
R 3.4.2 (R Core Team, 2017) were used for the LMM analyses. The log-likelihoods of
the models were analysed with the function anova (Pinheiro & Bates, 2000) to produce
the chi-square statistics.
Results
Preliminary analysis
For the SPV task, the average accuracy, including fillers, was .92 (SD ¼ .07), and the d’
prime was 2.98. The high percentage of correct responses indicates that the partici-
pants understood the procedure adequately, but the fillers were not included in the
reaction-time analyses. The accuracy was similar across conditions of perceptual simu-
lation (i.e., matching and mismatching, F ¼ 0.44, p ¼ .51, g 2 ¼ .01), indicating
(1, 92) p
that the participants were equally good at making the correct judgments for the two
conditions. The analysis of response times excluded all error trials. In addition, all trials
(4.61%) with response times shorter than 300ms or longer than 3,000ms were
removed (Engelen et al., 2011). The response times that were three standard devia-
tions above or below a participants’ condition mean for correct responses (0.76%)
were excluded. The results of the SPV task, Chinese character reading, nonverbal intel-
ligence, and working memory are summarised in Table 1.

596 Z.XUANDD.LIU
Linear mixed model analysis
As there was no significant difference in the accuracy of the perceptual matching and
mismatching conditions in the SPV task, consistent with the previous studies
(de Koning et al., 2017; Engelen et al., 2011), we utilised the response times for further
analysis of perceptual simulation. A primary LMM model was constructed for percep-
tual simulation in Chinese children’s language comprehension. The dependent variable
was the response time for the correct responses in the SPV task. The perceptual simu-
lation condition (i.e., matching or mismatching) was entered as a fixed variable. In
addition, the fixed variables included the covariates, i.e., age, gender, nonverbal intelli-
gence, working memory, word frequency of the target words in experimental senten-
ces (mean frequency was .07, ranging from .01 to .25), the BOI ratings of the target
words and pictures, and the experiment version in the SPV task.
The random factors included random intercepts by participants and items. In add-
ition, random slopes of the perceptual simulation condition, the word frequency, the
BOI ratings of the experimental pictures and words, and the experimental version by
participants, as well as random slopes of age, gender, nonverbal intelligence, and
working memory by items were involved. To overcome the problem of collinearity,
the continuous variables (i.e., response times, working memory, age, nonverbal intelli-
gence, word frequency, and the BOI ratings of the experimental pictures and words)
were centred by the z-score transformation of raw scores. The primary LMM model
results showed that the main effect of perceptual condition was significant; the chil-
dren needed more time (91.47ms) to respond correctly to the perceptual mismatching
stimulus than to the perceptual matching one.
Next, we added Chinese character reading as a fixed continuous factor into the pri-
mary model to construct the second LMM to investigate a possible role of literacy abil-
ity in the perceptual simulation. The Chinese character reading scores for the first and
second occasions were entered into a longitudinal sub-model and a concurrent sub-
model of the second LMM, respectively. As well, a random slope of the corresponding
score of Chinese character reading by items was added into these two sub-models.
For the second LMM, the results of its two sub-models were consistent and illustrated
that, after adding the Chinese character reading, the effect of the perceptual condition
was significant. The effects of Chinese character reading in the two sub-models were
not significant, demonstrating that the performance in the language comprehension
task in the current sample did not differ across children with different literacy abilities.
The chi-square statistics of the models showed that, compared to the primary model,
the second model (the longitudinal sub-model: p ¼ .97; the concurrent sub-model: p
¼ .99) did not lead to a significant improvement.
To explore further the possible relationship between perceptual simulation and lit-
eracy ability, we constructed the final LMM by adding the interaction between percep-
tual condition and Chinese character reading, i.e., perceptual condition(cid:2)Chinese
character reading (see Appendix B), to the second LMM. Similar to the second LMM,
the Chinese character reading scores for the two occasions were entered into the cor-
responding sub-models. The results of the two sub-models of the final LMM were con-
sistent and showed that, in addition to the effect of perceptual condition, the
interaction between perceptual condition and Chinese character reading was

significant. The perceptual simulation correlated negatively with performance on
Chinese character reading; the lower the score for the Chinese character reading task,
the larger the mismatch effect (see Figure 2). Moreover, the chi-square statistics for
the models showed that the final model (the longitudinal sub-model: p ¼ .02; the con-
current sub-model: p ¼ .04) led to a significant improvement, whereas the second one
did not. That is, the interaction between perceptual condition and Chinese character
reading had a unique prediction effect on the response time for the SPV task. The
results for these three models are summarised in Table 2.
Discussion
The current study sought to examine the role of perceptual simulation in Chinese-
speaking children’s language comprehension and, further, to explore its relationship
with children’s literacy abilities. Consistent with the previous studies in alphabetic lan-
guages (e.g., Engelen et al., 2011; Seger et al., 2020), the current study revealed a sig-
nificant mismatch effect for perceptual simulation in Chinese children. Moreover, the
study extended the findings of perceptual simulation in children by demonstrating a
negative correlational relationship between it and literacy ability. Compared to chil-
dren who had developed literacy abilities (i.e., those who had higher scores on the
Chinese character reading task in the current study), those with less developed literacy
abilities presented perceptual simulation to a larger extent in language
comprehension.

Overall, on the perceptual simulation task, the children verified the pictures faster
when they matched perceptually with the preceding sentence than when they were
mismatched. This result illustrated that, once language processing became effortful,

the Chinese children could reactivate related perceptual representations of the con-
cepts (Engelen et al., 2011). In light of these results, it is important to consider the
role of perceptual information in the acquisition of concepts and construction of child-
ren’s mental lexicons. When acquiring new concepts, children can integrate linguistic
symbols with the corresponding perceptual properties of referents to construct and
organise the mental lexicon (Smith & Gasser, 2005).
Specifically, the perceptual information is involved in the conceptual acquisition
and the development of mental lexicon at an early stage (Louwerse et al., 2015), that
is, the mapping of names to objects, for example, the name ‘ball’ to an actual ball.
After learning some individual objects, children need to generalise the structures of
individual categories, e.g., the knowledge that all balls are round. Thus, they can rec-
ognise novel balls according to this perceptual property. In turn, the perceptual repre-
sentation can be reactivated during language comprehension of related concepts. The

EDUCATIONALPSYCHOLOGY 599
current findings, combined with those of previous studies with Chinese adults (Li
et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2005), highlight the critical role of perceptual representation
in language comprehension in Chinese.
Relationship between perceptual simulation and literacy ability in
Chinese children
The present study examined the relationship between perceptual simulation and liter-
acy ability in Chinese children. As an indicator for the general literacy ability, Chinese
character reading scores for two occasions were adopted to represent the participants’
earlier (i.e., one year before) and concurrent literacy abilities. The results for the two
occasions were consistent; i.e., larger mismatch effects of the perceptual simulation
were observed in the children with less developed literacy abilities (i.e., lower scores
on the Chinese character reading task in the current sample).
This result was inconsistent with that of Engelen et al. (2011), in which children
with distinctive literacy abilities showed similar mismatch effects. This might be attrib-
uted to a difference in approaches; while Engelen et al. (2011) used the dichotomy
approach to analyse literacy ability, it was investigated individually with the linear
mixed models in the present study. In addition, the covariates that might influence
the relationship, such as age and the BOI rating of concepts were controlled in the
current study, but not in Engelen et al. (2011). This result was also opposite to the
finding of Tabiee et al. (2021). As mentioned before, this might have been because
the children with less developed literacy abilities in the Tabiee et al. (2021) study were
those with dyslexia. According to previous studies (Bosse et al., 2007), (some) children
with dyslexia may also have perceptual (e.g., visual) difficulties, which can lead to
impairments in acquiring sensorimotor experiences, which may influence the relation-
ship between perceptual simulation and literacy ability.
The present study found that the less skilled readers utilised more perceptual repre-
sentations for language processing than the skilled readers did. The less skilled readers
were supposed to have relatively less developed literacy abilities than the skilled read-
ers did (Perfetti et al., 2005). However, in the current sample, the overall performances
on that task for language comprehension were similar for children with distinctive lit-
eracy abilities. Considering that both linguistic and embodied systems can be reacti-
vated to assist processing in language comprehension (Louwerse et al., 2015), it is
possible that, for less skilled readers, more perceptual representations could be reacti-
vated and utilised to compensate the shortfall of linguistic representations. In contrast,
the skilled readers could retrieve enough concept-related representations from the lin-
guistic system, which peaks before the embodied system does (Louwerse et al., 2015),
to enable them to give correct responses in the language comprehension task. As a
consequence, the mismatch effect was smaller in the children with more developed
literacy abilities.
An alternative interpretation is related to the feature of the SPV task. Previous stud-
ies have demonstrated that processing linguistic stimuli (e.g., reading/listening to the
sentence) can activate related perceptual representations; as well, processing percep-
tual stimuli (e.g., processing the picture) can activate corresponding semantic

600 Z.XUANDD.LIU
representations (Estes et al., 2008). Thus, there were at least two routes for children to
complete the SPV task. One route focussed on the perceptual representation, utilising
the perceptual representation that was reactivated when reading/listening to the sen-
tence to compare with the perceptual features that were depicted in the subsequent
picture. The second route related to the linguistic representation, in which the seman-
tic representation of the object in the picture was compared to the concept in the
preceding sentence.
As described before, in the SPV task, the picture in either condition depicted the
object that was mentioned in the preceding sentence. Although the perceptual repre-
sentation can be reactivated automatically during language comprehension (Barsalou
et al., 2008; Louwerse, 2018), a correct answer can be given without comparing the
perceptual representations of the sentence-picture pair. Thus, the perceptual represen-
tations of concepts seem to be irrelevant/inappropriate to the current task, especially
for the trials in the perceptual mismatch condition. Previous work found that less
skilled readers are less competent than their typical counterparts in suppressing dis-
tracting information while performing some semantic-related tasks (e.g., Chiappe et al.,
2000). It is possible that the skilled readers may be better at switching to use the
semantic route when they find the perceptual features of the picture are inconsistent
with the perceptual representation reactivated by the preceding sentence. On the con-
trary, the less skilled readers may have difficulties in suppressing the comparison of
the perceptual representations, even when they are irrelevant/inappropriate to com-
pleting the task. Thus, the inconsistent perceptual representations of the sentence-pic-
ture pair in the perceptual mismatch condition would increase the difficulty in giving
a correct answer, resulting in a larger mismatch effect. Notably, the current data did
not indicate which of the possible interpretations is correct. Future studies are
required to examine the two possible explanations.
Limitations and future studies
This study had some limitations. First, the current findings suggest perceptual simula-
tion in language comprehension in Chinese children, however, it is still not clear which
linguistic components of the sentence are critical for perceptual simulation. Also, it is
possible that children with distinctive literacy abilities perform differently in recognis-
ing the critical component, which may influence the perceptual simulation. Future
studies could manipulate linguistic components (e.g., the object or the situation/
space), as well as use the approaches such as eye-tracking or neurological techniques,
to investigate how and to what extent children can recognise the words included in
the task for the perceptual simulation.
Second, the interpretation about suppression was based on previous findings about
the automatic reactivation of perceptual representations in language comprehension
(Barsalou et al., 2008) and a better ability to suppress inappropriate information in typ-
ically developing children (Chiappe et al., 2000). Consider the correlation between
working memory and the ability of suppression (Cain, 2006), we further examined the
role of working memory in the relationship between perceptual simulation and literacy
ability (see Appendix C). The results did not show any effects of working memory on

EDUCATIONALPSYCHOLOGY 601
the perceptual simulation or its relationship with literacy ability (ps > .05). However,
to examine this interpretation empirically, future studies could add a task to measure
children’s inhibition control for inappropriate information in language comprehension.
Third, a larger sample size with different age groups should be included in future
studies to explore the development of perceptual simulation and its relationship with
literacy ability. As well, reading tasks with different difficulty levels (e.g., language
comprehension at the next level), which could yield a larger effect size for perceptual
simulation factors than for linguistic statistic factors (Louwerse et al., 2015), could be
used to test whether this relationship will be different.
Finally, to reduce the influence of the stimuli, the current study utilised concepts
that are familiar to children. Also, only one type of interval was included in the pre-
sent study to provide enough time for children to comprehend a sentence (Engelen
et al., 2011). However, shorter intervals could impact the perceptual simulation (e.g., Li
et al., 2007). Future studies should involve concepts with different levels of familiarity,
as well as different intervals in the SPV task to investigate whether the relationship
between perceptual simulation and reading will be different.
Theoretical and educational implications
Consistent with the symbol interdependency hypothesis (Louwerse et al., 2015), the
current study demonstrated the perceptual simulation in Chinese children’s language
processing. Moreover, the current study illustrated that the extent of perceptual simu-
lation could be modulated by differences in children’s literacy performances (i.e.,
Chinese character reading). Specifically, since children with less developed literacy abil-
ities have relatively less linguistic knowledge, they can reactivate more perceptual rep-
resentations to construct a relatively complete situation model to facilitate language
comprehension. On the other hand, children with more developed literacy abilities
may have enough linguistic knowledge to support efficient processing. Accordingly,
fewer perceptual representations are reactivated for language processing. At the same
time, it is possible that children with more developed literacy abilities can suppress
the goal-irrelevant information more easily and switch to symbolic knowledge to com-
prehend language once they find embodied information inconsistent with the seman-
tic cues.
Practically, the current study suggests that corresponding perceptual information
should be involved in children’s concept acquisition, to enhance the representations
of these concepts. Moreover, the relationship between perceptual simulation and liter-
acy ability supports that teaching approaches should be varied for children with differ-
ent literacy abilities. That is, in addition to integrating the symbolic and sensorimotor
information of new characters, the control of inhibiting irrelevant and/or inappropriate
information should be involved in literacy acquisition, especially for readers with poor
literacy performances.
