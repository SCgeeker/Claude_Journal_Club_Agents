picture either showed the original/modified state of an object that was mentioned in the sentence (e.g., “mango”
in Experiment 1) or not (e.g., “banana” in Experiments 2A and 2B). The results of Experiment 1 demonstrated
that the objects in a modified state were verified faster when a sentence implied a substantial state-change rather
than a minimal state-change. In contrast, the reverse was true for the objects in the original state. Importantly,
verification latencies of pictures depicting original and modified states of an object in the substantial state-
change condition were approximately similar, thus suggesting that language comprehenders maintain multiple
representations of an object in different states. The results of Experiments 2A and 2B revealed that when par-
ticipants had to indicate that a pictured object (e.g., banana) was not mentioned in the sentence, their verifi-
cation latencies were slowed down when the sentence contained a semantically related item (e.g., mango) and
described this item as being changed substantially by the action. However, these verification latencies varied
continuously with the degree of change: the more dissimilar the states of a semantically related item, the less
time participants needed to verify a pictured object. The results are discussed through the prism of theories
emphasizing dynamic views of event cognition.

All statistical analyses in Experiments 1 to 2B were conducted in the

mixed-effects modeling. The full model4 included sentence type (mini-
mal change vs. substantial change), picture type (original state vs.
modified state), and their interaction as fixed effects; and by-participant
and by-item random intercepts. Additionally, the model also included
by-participant random slopes for sentence type, picture type, as well as
the interaction term. If the estimation procedure for the full random-
effects specification resulted in non-convergence or overfitting warn-
ings, we simplified the model’s random-effects structure by first
removing random correlations (see Barr et al., 2013, for further dis-
cussion). If this did not help, then we removed random slopes that had
little influence on the results. The decision to simplify a “maximal”
model was driven by the need to balance Type I error and power, given
that “maximal” models lose power if their complexity is not supported
by the data (Matuschek et al., 2017). The final random-effects structure
of each model (for each experiment) used to report the results is speci-
fied in Tables 1, 3, and 4. The fixed effects predictors were sum-coded
