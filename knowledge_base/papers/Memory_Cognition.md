Abstract
Pictures of objects are verified faster when they match the implied orientation, shape, and color in a sentence-picture
verification task, suggesting that people mentally simulate these features during language comprehension. Previous studies
had an unintended correlation between match status and the required response, which may have influenced participants’
responses by eliciting strategic use of this correlation. We removed this correlation by including color-matching filler
trials and investigated if the color-match effect was still obtained. In both a native sample (Experiment 1) and a non-native
sample (Experiment 2), we found strong evidence for a color-match advantage on median reaction time and error rates. Our
results are consistent with the view that color is automatically simulated during language comprehension as predicted by
the grounded cognition framework.
