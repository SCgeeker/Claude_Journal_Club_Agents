A single origin of numeral classifiers
in Asia and the Pacific
A hypothesis

1Tunghai University|2National Chengchi University
A world map of more than 700 numeral classifier languages shows a pattern
of distribution due to diffusion, where the classifier feature radiates outward
from a clear center of clustering in Southeast Asia and classifier languages
gradually thin out and with less intensive use of classifiers (Gil 2013;Her
etal. 2015). A hypothesis of a single origin seems appealing to account for
this particular pattern of distribution. We propose that in Asia and the
Pacific numeral classifiers developed indigenously in one language group
initially and all other classifier languages acquired this feature via language
contact. The hypothesis thus excludes Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea,
and the Americas, pending further research. Based on the evidence
available, we argue that, betweenTai-Kadaiand Sinitic, the latter is more
likely the single origin for Asia and the Pacific, and we also consider a
possible cause of the rise of classifiers in Sinitic.

1. Introduction
Numeral classifiers typically appear with a numeral quantifier. This feature cru-
cially distinguishes them from noun classes, or genders, which form an integral
partofanoun,havingnothingtodowiththepresenceorabsenceofanumeral

Inmostclassifierlanguages,thepositionoftheclassifier(CLF)canalsobefilled
by a measure word (MENS), as in (2a–b). Her & Lai (2012) distinguish close to
one hundred classifiers in Mandarin from a vast number of MENSs. The latter

known as ‘sortal classifiers’ and ‘mensural classifiers’ (e.g., Huang 2013; Saikia
& Allassonnière-Tang, this volume), and ‘classifiers’ and ‘massifiers’ (e.g., Cheng
& Sybesma 1998), respectively, among various other lesser-known terms. In this

The use of numeral classifiers, or C/Ms, has long been considered a promi-
nent areal feature of languages in East and Southeast Asia (e.g., Greenberg 1990
[1974]; Bisang 1999; Aikhenvald 2000:121). Jones (1970) and a number of other
scholars have suggested that this areal feature is due to areal diffusion with Tai
as the original center, though the dominant view among linguists in China is
that C/Ms developed independently first in Sinitic languages (e.g., Wang 1994).
Such characterizations have often led to an earlier misconception that C/Ms do

notoccurinEuropeanlanguages.Forinstance,Rijkhoff(1998:328)states“sortal
classifiers are generally absent in the European languages”. However, as several
surveysdemonstrate–mostnotablyGreenberg(1990[1972]),Aikhenvald(2000),
andGil(2013),eachcovering103,116,and140classifierlanguages,respectively–
classifier languages also exist in the Pacific islands, Europe, and all other popu-
lated continents, except Australia.1,2 Our first goal is to introduce a geographic
information system (GIS) database of 713 numeral classifier languages in the
world. Based on the distribution pattern of these 713 languages on a world map,
a pattern emerges that is indeed rather similar to those in a diffusion scenario.

While Janhunen talks only about East Asia, we expand the scope to Asia and
the Pacific. Furthermore, though Janhunen (2000:705) sees no specific reason
to favor Sinitic as the original innovator of numeral classifiers in Asia, he offers

The organization of this chapter is as follows. Section2 introduces a GIS

2.1 Distribution of classifier languages in the world
To our knowledge, the earliest attempt at a survey of the world’s classifier lan-
guages is Greenberg (1990 [1972]), where 103 classifier languages were investi-
gated.AmorerecentsurveybyGil(2013)identifies140classifierlanguagesamong

available in its World Language Mapping System (WLMS) (Lewis etal. 2016).
Data for numeral classifiers as well as numerals in each language were then
collected via a survey of existing literature. A language is marked as a classifier
language if an author explicitly states that it is a numeral classifier language or
certain elements in their data are clearly and appropriately marked as numeral
classifiers. There are of course cases of disagreement in the literature, where we

as we will soon discuss in Section2.2, such elements must form a multiplicative
relation with the adjacent numeral and represent the value of 1 as the multipli-

12.4% of the world’s languages. SeeTable1for a summary.

boundary of classifier languages in the Pacific seems to coincide with the Inter-
national Date Line. To the north of SMATTI, there are classifier languages such
as Korean and Japonic languages in the east, but in the west, only a few Altaic
classifier languages can be found within the borders of China, but not further
into Siberia.11 In the south, some Dravidian classifier languages are found, but
theyarecertainlynotasabundantastheirneighborsinthenorth.Classifierlan-
guages in the west also exhibit this pattern of distribution. While Indo-Aryan is

results in a higher degree of variation and more intensive use of the feature.
During its development, it may also diffuse to neighboring languages, and the
intensity and diversity drop down gradually due to partial borrowing or shorter
periodsofdevelopment(e.g.,Trudgill1974;Aikhenvald&Dixon2001;Cathcart

AnothermotivationforproposingasingleoriginfrominsideSMATTIistheclear

theTibeto-Burmanphenomenon,weneedtointroduceamultiplicativetheoryas
apreliminary,whichunitesC/Mwithnumeralbasesinthenumeralsystemfrom
amathematicalperspective(Her2012,2017a,2017b).Consideranumeralsystem
with both addition and multiplication, for which Comrie (2006) gives a concise
formulation, as in(3).
(3) General Pattern of Numeral Expressions (Comrie 2006)
(n × base) +m, wherem<base
A more detailed description is offered inComrie (2013):
Bythe“base”ofanumeralsystemwemeanthevaluensuchthatnumeralexpres-
sionsareconstructedaccordingtothepattern…xn+y,i.e.,somenumeralxmul-
tipliedbythebaseplussomeothernumeral.(Theorderofelementsisirrelevant,

in which the numeral 26 is expressed as in(1).

InMandarin,theconventionisthatthenumeralbeforethewordfor10istobe
multipliedby10,whilethatafterthewordfor10istobeaddedtothisproduct
([2×10]+6). (Comrie 2013)
Sincetherelationbetweenthenandthebase,e.g.,èr“two”andshí“ten”inMan-
darin is multiplication, the linear order between the two is irrelevant and does
indeed vary across languages.
Asfornumeralclassifiers,asmentionedabove,thepositionwhereaclassifier
appears can also be filled by a measure word. How to distinguish between clas-
sifiers and measure words has been a contentious issue (e.g., Hsieh 2008; Her
& Hsieh 2010). Her (2012) proposes a precise multiplication-based account for
thisdistinction,synthesizingtheinsightsgainedfromLandman(2004),AuYeung
(2005,2007),andYi(2009),i.e.,[NumC/M]canbeseenmathematicallyas[mul-
tiplier×multiplicand],exactlylikethe[nbase]relationinanumeralsuchasèr‑shí

b. sanke pingguo (Num × CLF=3 × 1)

3 mens.dozenapple
“three dozen apples”
b. sanxiang pingguo (Num × MENS.box=3 × box)
3 mens.boxapple
“three boxes of apples”
From this mathematical perspective, classifiers and measure words are unified
under the function as multiplicands and also distinguished in terms of their
respectivevalues,i.e.,aclassifiermusthavetheprecisenumericalvalueof1,but
ameasurewordmustnot.Measurewordscanhaveanyvalue,numericalornon-
numerical, except 1 (Her 2012). In other words, a measure word always implies
anaggregateratherthananindividual.Classifiersandmeasurewordsthusform
thetwosubcategoriesofasinglesyntacticcategory,C/M.Giventhefactthatthe
mathematicalfunctionof[NumC/M]isexactlythesameas[n×base],i.e.,[mul-
tiplier × multiplicand], it is to be expected that, within the same language, the
two should behave the same in terms of their relative order with the multiplier.
This effect is called ‘harmonization’ by Greenberg (1990 [1978]:293). Extending
Greenberg’sinitialobservation,Heretal.(2015),Her(2017a,2017b),andHeretal.
(2019)proposeexplicitlythatthereisharmonizationinwordorderbetweenC/M
and base within a nominal phrase composed of Num, C/M, and N, as stated in
(6),whereC/M-finalmeans[NumC/M],andC/M-initial,[C/MNum];likewise,
base-final means [n base], and base-initial, [base n]. C/M and base are seen as
heads due to their function as the multiplicand.
(6) Harmonization in word order between C/M andbase(Her 2017a:43)
a. C/M-final⇒base-final
b. C/M-initial⇒base-initial
Theinsightisthatanumeralwithaninternal[nbase]ordermustprecedeC/M,or

sequence is that, cross-linguistically, among the three elements, n, base, and C/

formed(Her2017b).ThisalsoexplainswhyNdoesnotintervenebetweenNum
and C/M.
Her etal. (2015) demonstrate that such base-C/M harmonization is indeed
substantiated in SMATTI, i.e., out of 232 classifier languages, of which we
obtained data for 218 languages, harmonization is observed in 213 languages,
about 91.8% (213/232); see Figure4 for their distribution. Specifically, 186 lan-
guageshavebase-finalandC/M-finalwordorder,and27others,base-initialand
C/M-initial.
Figure4. Classifier languages in SMATTI (red dots forbase-final, yellow dots for
base-initial, blue circles for violations)
Interestingly, the 27 base-initial, C/M-initial languages, along with the five
exceptions, are all Tibeto-Burman. Yet, far more Tibeto-Burman languages are
foundtobebase-finalandC/M-final;66tobeexact.ThefactthatTBistheonly
languagegroupinSMATTIwherebase-initialnumeralsarefoundsuggestsquite
strongly that such numerals are remnants from Proto-Tibeto-Burman (PTB).
Indeed,Kiryu(2009:64–66)hypothesizesthatPTBhasanumeralsystemthatis
base-initial, i.e., [base n],12 while C/Ms as well as the [n base] order were due to
12. Notethatonp.65ofKiryu(2009),thesecondofthethreeassumptionsof(11)states:“The
Proto-Tibeto-Burman order of numeral and quantifier was Num-Q.” Num-Q here is a typo,
whichis[nbase]inourterminology.Ithasbeenconfirmedwiththeauthorviapersonalcom-
municationthattheintendedorderwasQ-Num,i.e.,[basen],instead.Thismakesbettersense
since on p.64 he correctly states thatCLS-Numis the default order inTibeto-Burman.

and also C/M-final. This view is consistent with Fu’s (2015:50) position that the
defaultorderbetweenNandNuminTBis[NNum],especiallywithNumseen
as a complex unit composed of a C/M and a numeral.
Currently,however,roughly19.8%(92/465)ofTBlanguagesarebase-initial,

development.

Thedistributionofnumeralclassifiers,ahotbedphenomenonforwhichthereis

guages are too far apart from numeral classifier languages of other parts of the
world.Also,inbetweentheselanguagesandSMATTIisagreatnumberofAfro-
Asiatic,Nilo-Saharan,andNiger-Congolanguageswithoutclassifiers.Itisthere-
fore quite improbable that contact with Asian languages has played any
meaningful role in the rise of numeral classifiers in Africa. On the other hand,
Niger-Congo languages feature the use of noun classes, where a certain prefix
is attached to the noun stem according to the class of the noun, regardless of
whether numerals are used. It is much more likely that numeral classifiers in
African languages arise by themselves from the noun class system.

relatively scarce, and currently no inference regarding borrowing of classifiers
canbedrawn.
AsforEurope,eventhoughtherearemanyclassifierlanguageswithinIndo-
European,especiallyintheIndo-AryanandIranianbranches,thehandfuliden-

include Breton, Bulgarian, Irish Gaelic, Polish, Russian, Standard German, and

garian(Uralic).Furtherresearchisrequiredtofirmlyestablishtheproperstatus

2.4 Competing candidates for the single origin
The two most likely candidates for a single origin are Tai-Kadai and Sinitic, the
twogroupsthatenjoythehighestpercentageofclassifierlanguages,alsotheonly

On the other hand, at least 50 out of 94 Tai-Kadai languages are attested to
have classifiers; for the remaining 44 languages there is insufficient data for us
to determine whether they have classifiers. Tai, with 76 languages, is the largest
branchinTai-Kadaiandhascurrently39attestedclassifierlanguagesinourdata-
base. While the percentages, 51% (39/76) in Tai, 61% (11/18) in Kadai, and 53%
(50/94)overall,seemmuchlowerincomparisonwithSinitic,webelieveitisdue
to the lack of data or our lack of access to some of the published data of these
languages. In all the literature we have surveyed, not one Tai-Kadai language is
referred to as not having C/Ms, and we are fairly confident that further investi-

there is no way from written records alone to demonstrate a time of emergence

favorSiniticoverTai-Kadai,thoughtheissueisnotyetsettled,asindicatedinthe
following quote:
If we follow the predominant point of view that the Tai languages originally
belong to the Austronesian family, then it would look more probable that Tais

WewillreturntothisissueinSection4andfurthercomparethetwocandidates,
ultimately arguing for Sinitic, but we should first demonstrate that it is a viable
claim that other language groups besides Tai-Kadai and Sinitic in and around

two language groups.
3. Evidence of language phyla borrowing classifiers
Inthissectionweconsiderotherlanguagefamiliesintheworldanddemonstrate
thatnoneofthemislikelytohaveinheritedtheclassifierfeaturegeneticallyfrom
an earlier ancestral language, and a much more plausible explanation is indeed
areal diffusion via language contact, directly or indirectly, with Tai-Kadai and/
or Sinitic. First we examine language families in SMATTI in the order of the

languages identified may turn out to be misidentified.

guages, including Japonic, Korean, and Altaic languages.
3.1 Miao-Yao(Hmong-Mien)
There are 39 Miao-Yao languages, mostly spoken in the mountainous areas of
southern China, northern Laos, and northern Vietnam. Situated between Sino-
Tibetan, Tai-Kadai, and Austroasiatic families, the distribution of Miao-Yao lan-
guagesisrathersporadic,butcanstillbecategorizedintoMiao(Hmongic)inthe
west and Yao (Mienic) in the east, with the She language (畲語) being an out-
lier. So far, we have confirmed that at least 14 are classifier languages. Again, we
suspectthatmanymorewillbeidentifieduponfurtherresearch,astheaccepted
viewisthatclassifiersystemsareacommonMiao-Yaofeature.Bu(2011a)summa-
rizes the grammatical functions of classifiers and the size of classifier inventory,
claimingspecificallythattheintensityofclassifieruseisthegreatestinTai,where
alargeinventoryofclassifiersservesmanysyntacticfunctions,islessinMiao-Yao,
whose classifiers have a comparable size of inventory but a more restricted syn-
tacticposition,andultimatelyistheleastinTibeto-Burman,whereclassifiersare
verylimitedinnumberanduse.Whatiscrucialtoourhypothesisisthefactthat
no classifiers have been reconstructed for Proto-Miao-Yao (Wang & Mao 1995;
Ratliff2010)andtheborrowingofclassifiersfromSiniticlanguageshasbeenpro-
posed (Ratliff 2000).
However, as the history of Miao-Yao involves a long period of contacts with
variouslanguagefamilies,toidentifythesourcesoftheinfluenceisdifficult.His-
torically, Miao-Yao has had intensive contact with Sinitic languages. Based on
genetic and linguistic evidence, the homeland of the Miao-Yao people may have
been from somewhere north of their current territories to the south of Yangtze
River for more than 2000 years (Wen etal. 2004; Ratliff 2009:643). During the
historyofChineseexpansion,Miao-Yaopeoplehavebeenforcedtomigratetothe
southintomodernLaosandThailand(Blench2004).Languagecontactsbetween
Sinitic languages and Tai-Kadai, the two candidates for our single origin, are
inevitable.
Asfortheevidenceforthesourceoftheinfluence,classifiersinMiao-Yaolan-
guagessharefeatureswithbothSiniticandTai-Kadailanguages,e.g.,Cantonese
andTai.Forexample,abareclassifierphrase[CLFN]inMiao-Yaolanguagescan
markdefiniteness,whichisafeaturealsofoundinsouthernSiniticlanguages,but
not in Mandarin (Bisang 1993; Li & Bisang 2012). In terms of word order, Tai-
KadailanguagestothesouthhaveanN-initialorder(i.e.,[NNumCLF]),while

130 One-SoonHer&Bing-TsiongLi
Sinitic languages, as well as Tai-Kadai languages in the north, have an N-final
order(i.e.,[NumCLFN]).Miao-YaolanguagesarelikeSiniticlanguagesinthis
regard (Enfield 2001:265).
Toresolvetheissue,wemayresortagaintodistribution.Haudricourt(1954)
observedthatMiao-YaoformsanintermediarygroupbetweenMon-Khmerand
Tibeto-Burman. This observation forms the basis for Bu’s (2011a) ‘concentric
model’ofclassifierdiffusion.Basedonthesummarymentionedabove,Bu(2011a)
claims that the three language families form a concentric circle, with Tai-Kadai
intheinnermostcircle,Miao-Yaotheintermediatecircle,andTibeto-Burmanthe
outermost circle. The strength of classifiers becomes weaker and weaker further
awayfromtheinnercircle,implyingascenarioofdiffusion.Wethussurmisethat
Miao-Yao classifiers are not indigenous and have been influenced more by Tai-
Kadaithan by Chinese.
3.2 Austroasiatic
The Austroasiatic family consists of 159 languages in Glottolog, in countries
located between China and Indonesia, with two main groups, i.e., Mon-Khmer
(137languages,54ofwhichareidentifiedinourdatabaseasaclassifierlanguage)
andMunda(22languages,4classifierlanguages).Genetic,epigraphic,andethno-
graphicevidencesuggeststhatAustroasiaticpeople,oratleastthegeneticances-
tors of Austroasiatic-speaking people, were the oldest inhabitants in peninsular
SoutheastAsiafrom4000yearsB.P.onwards(Lertritetal.2008).Whiletheissue
of the homeland and expansion of Austroasiatic languages remains contentious,
evidence of language contact with other language families in SMATTI has been
proposed.AseriesofwordsinOldChinesehavebeenproposedtohavebeenbor-
rowedfromAustroasiatic(Norman&Mei1976;Schuessler2007).Longafterthe
timeofthisborrowingintheeraofOldChinese,theexpansionofTaipeopleinto
thepeninsuladuringtheearlysecondmillenniumbroughtforthanotherwaveof
language contact. Lastly, the Munda branch, as an especially isolated branch in
South Asia, is certainly in contact with and influenced by the Indo-Aryan lan-
guages on the subcontinent.
Adams (1991), following Jones (1970), hypothesizes that the classifier system

This less intensive use of classifiers in Cambodian suggests a borrowed feature.

In addition to Tai languages, there are other possible sources for classifiers
inAustroasiaticlanguages,oneofwhichbeingSinitic.Vietnameseclassifiershave
been heavily influenced by, or borrowed from, Chinese, though some uses are
innovations (e.g., Benedict 1947; Alves 2016). Munda languages, on the other
hand,areinfluencedbyIndo-Aryaninmanyways,includingclassifiersystemsas

arenotindigenousinthislanguagefamilyandhavebeeninfluencedbythesur-
roundingIndo-Aryan,Tai-Kadai, and Sinitic languages.
3.3 Tibeto-Burman
As shown in Section2.2, within SMATTI, only Tibeto-Burman has base-initial,
C/M-initial languages, where the only five exceptions to the base-C/M harmo-
nization are also located. The overall geographical view of SMATTI in Figure4
revealsaclearpictureofTBsandwichedbetweenbase-final,C/M-finallanguages

LanguagecontactnotonlyaccountsforclassifiersinTB,butalsothemixed
patterns of numeral-internal orders, i.e., both base-initial systems and base-final
systems, the former being indigenous, the latter borrowed. This fact, taken
together with the strong tendency to harmonize base and C/M in word order,
constitutesthekeytothecomplexvariationofbaseandC/MwordordersinTB,
as shown in(10), which is derived from data presented inTable2.

Whilemuchmoreresearchissurelyneededtohaveabetterunderstandingof
thispatternofdistribution,thecrucialpointwewishtomakefromthescenario
depicted above is that the TB variation of base and C/M orders can only be
accountedforifweassumethatC/Masagrammaticalconcept,likethebase-final
numeral, was borrowed. Note, however, that in Matisoff’s (2003) Handbook of
Proto-Tibeto-Burman,asingleclassifierforhumans,*ra,isfound,onp.609,listed
in the Index of Proto-Forms. Yet, closer examination of related data in the book
indicatesthat*rainPTBislikelyanoun,notaclassifier.Theonlybasisforcon-
sidering *ra a classifier in PTB is given on p.170, where *k-ra is a PTB form
meaning “strength/win”. Matisoff (2003:170, fn. c) explains why this form *k-ra
and its meaning suggest that *ra is a classifier: “This seems certainly to be the
samerootas*ra‘humans(classifier)’,above3.4.2.Cf.Englishexpressionslike‘20
menstrong’.”
However, in the English expression 20 men strong or 20-man strong, men
or man is neither a classifier nor a measure word under a proper definition of
numeral classifiers. Also, on p.43, in §3.4.2, which the above quote refers to, *ra
islistedasaforminProto-Lolo-Burmese(PLB)meaning“CLFforhumans”,but
nocorrespondingforminPTBisgiven,whiletheentryrightbelowis“snake”*m-
əy in PLB and its PTB form *s-b-rul is given. These observations, coupled with
the fact that by far the majority of TB languages do not have classifiers, suggest
strongly that no classifiers should be reconstructed for PTB.

research is needed to confirm these initial observations.

Incidentally, word orders of numeral modifiers with respect to nouns may
also shed light on our hypothesis. Dryer (2008:49) suggests that languages with
numeral classifiers may exhibit a correlation between Num/N word order and
Num/CLFwordorder.Buthealsoadmitsthatthereisnostrongevidenceforsuch
aclaim.Itisindeedourhypothesisthatcross-linguisticallythereisacorrelation

guages consists of Num and a C/M. We are now testing this hypothesis using
Dryer’sdataonN-parameterinTibeto-Burmanandourdataonbase-parameter
andC/M-parameterinTibeto-Burman.Inotherwords,weshouldfindstatistical
significance in [N C/M base-n] and [n‑base C/M N] over other attested word

3.4 Dravidian
The next language group to be considered is Dravidian, a group located mainly
inthesouthofSMATTI,especiallysouthofIndo-Aryan.Dravidianlanguagesare
spoken in southern India, on the continent and on the islands of Lakshadweep,
andontheislandofSriLanka.Theyarealsospokensporadicallyinotherparts

nousfeature.
Except Tamil, all other classifier languages, i.e., Duruwa (Parji), Kurux
(Kurukh), Kui, Kuvi, Kolami, Malto, and Telugu, are distributed in the eastern
part of the subcontinent, on the fringes between Dravidian and Indo-Aryan
speakingareas.ThisisahintthatclassifiersinDravidianaretheresultoflanguage
contact. Emeneau (1956) finds that many of these languages borrowed some
numeralsfromtheneighboringIndo-Aryanlanguages,andsomealsoborrowed
theclassifiersystems;asaresult,classifiersareoftenusedonlywiththeborrowed
numerals,e.g.,inDuruwa,Kui,Kuvi,andKolami.Duruwa,forexample,having
possiblyborroweditsnumeralsfrom‘6’onfromHalbi,anIndo-Aryanlanguage,
uses the classifier jan for humans and goṭa for certain objects only with native
numerals‘5’andunder.Furthermore,thesimilaritiesthatjanandgoṭabearwith
theircounterpartintheIndo-Aryanlanguagesnearbyfurtherimplythisborrow-
ingrelation(cf.zɔninAssamese,janinHalbi,janainBengali(Barz&Diller1985)
and ʈo/ʈa in Nepali (Pokharel 2010)).17 Although few claims are made regarding
Telugu and Malto, it is also conjectured in Emeneau (1956) that they developed
classifier systems under the influence ofIndo-Aryanclassifier languages.
