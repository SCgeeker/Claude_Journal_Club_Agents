1. Introduction
The notions of individuals, kinds and events are three useful, albeit abstract,
semantic distinctions found in formal semantic theories. These concepts usually
involve separate domains of inquiry within formal semantics, but Lyons (1995),

summarizes the prevailing viewpoint concerning these concepts in the two passages
below.
ThroughoutthisbookIhaveadoptedtheviewpointofnaı¨verealism,according
to which the ontological structure of the world is objectively independent both
ofperceptionandcognitionandalsooflanguage....Accordingtotheviewpoint
adopted here, the world contains a number of first-order entities (with first-
order properties) which fall into certain ontological categories (or natural
kinds); it also contains aggregates of stuff or matter (with first-order proper-
ties), portions of which can be individuated, quantified, enumerated—and thus
treatedlinguisticallyasentities—byusingthelexicalandgrammaticalresources
of particular natural languages. All natural languages, it may be assumed,
provide their users with the means of referring to first-order entities and
expressing propositions which describe them in terms of their (first-order)
properties, actual or ascribed, essential or contingent: such languages have the
expressivepower offirst-orderformallanguages(p. 325).
In the above passage, Lyons argues for the existence of kinds and individuals, as
well groups of individuals that can be apportioned. These concepts are available to
allhumanlanguages,andalllanguagesthathavetheseconceptsareconsideredtobe
first-orderformallanguages.
Lyons is less certain about the concept of event being present in all natural lan-
guages, asthe followingpassage shows:
Whether all natural languages have the greater expressive power of various
kinds of higher-order formal languages is a more controversial, and as yet
empiricallyunresolved,question. But some natural languages certainly do; and
[such languages enable] users to reify, or hypostatize, the properties of first-
order entities, the relations that obtain among them, and the processes, activ-
ities, and states of affairs (and other kinds of situations) in which they are
involved(p. 325).
Higher-order languages, then, allow users to understand abstract concepts as con-
crete (i.e. through metaphorization). Higher-order languages can also describe the
events in which first-order entities are involved. Lyons argues that English is a
higher-order language.
It is interesting to note that Lyons rejects the notion that there is an underlying
linguistic or cognitive motivation for the concepts of individuals, kinds and events
(i.e. ‘the ontological structure of the world is objectively independent both of per-
ception and cognition and also of language’). Moreover, these three concepts are
treatedasdistinctbyformalsemanticists,andnotaspartofaunifiedsystem.Butwe
will show in this paper that these concepts are part of a coherent and conceptually
motivatedgrammaticalsystem.Wewillshowthatindividuals,kinds,andeventsare
reflected in the classifier system of Mandarin Chinese, a linguistic system based on
cognitiveprinciples.

C.-R.Huang,K.Ahrens/LanguageSciences25(2003)353–373 355
Thisfindingisrelevantforthefollowingreasons:first,itchallengesthetraditional
treatment ofindividualasoneofthebasicsemanticconcepts.Inotherwords,when
individuals,kindsandeventssharethesameleveloflinguistic/cognitivetaxonomy,a
treatment that puts one of them (individuals) as basic and the others derived needs
to be re-examined. Second, this classification allows a fresh look at the complex
semantic concepts of nouns, and at the interaction and coercion that takes place
between classifiers and nouns. Third, it explains why the kind reading in Mandarin
Chinese occurs with a subset of classifiers in addition to its function as a generic
reading typical of bare nominals.1 Lastly, for each noun type (i.e. individual, kind
and event nouns) the corresponding classifier type creates a taxonomic system. The
fact that the more abstract noun types (i.e. events and kinds) can be classified by a
grammaticalized system offers the strongest empirical support for their conceptual
felicity, since it is the first time that previously abstract semantic distinctions
between kinds, individuals and events is found to be instantiated as a particular
system of a natural language grammar. It isimportant to note that it is well known
thatlinguisticdevicescanbe used to mark the distinctions of individual, kind, and
event. However, there are two crucial differences between these cases and the
Chinese classifier system that we are discussing now. First, previous cases all
involve grammatical devices that are independently motivated and are taken from
separate grammatical levels or systems, while the classifier system we discuss here is
a single integral grammatical system. Second, previous cases involve representa-
tional clues that typically, but not always, mark the semantic distinction, while the
Chinese classifier system entails the exact grammatical function to categorize these
semantic distinctions. In other words, there are two possible levels of grammatica-
lization. A distinction is grammaticalized if the contrasting elements can be dis-
tinguished by some representational clues. However, a system of categorization is
grammaticalized only when the whole system is given corresponding grammatical
representations.2
This paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we distinguish classifiers from
measure words in Mandarin Chinese and we give an overview of the data on which
our study was based. In the third section, we present evidence for the individual
readings of nouns and demonstrate that nouns can occur with more than one indi-
vidual classifier, and that these occurrences coerce different meanings from the
noun. In the fourth section, we discuss the kind readings of classifiers and demon-
strate that kind classifiers select a particular class of nouns. In the fifth section, we
demonstrate that the Mandarin classifier system also contains classifiers that can
coerce an event reading from a nominal. In the last section, we summarize our
findings, giving examples of nouns that can be coerced to all three readings, indivi-
dual, kindand event, and suggest future areas forstudy.

2. Background
In the following section we define classifiers as contrasted with measure words,
and we discuss thescope and source ofclassifiers used in our study.
2.1. Classifiers and measure words
TwotraditionsofstudyofclassifiersexistinMandarinChinese.Theclassicalview
does not differentiate measure words from classifiers. For example, Chao (1968:
584–620) refers to classifiers as individual measures, and subsumes them under the
rubric of ‘‘measure words’’. Li and Thompson (1981: 106) state that ‘‘any measure
word canbe a classifier’’.
However, another tradition is based on the premise that measure words are dis-
tinguishable from classifiers on the basis of a simple syntactic test (Kuo, 1998; Tai
and Chao, 1994): Can the genitive de particle be inserted between the classifier/
measurewordanditsnoun?In(1)below,decannotbeinserted,sobenisaclassifier.
But in (2),de can be inserted, thus kuai isa measureword.
(1a) yi ben shu
one CL book
‘one book’
(1b) *yi ben de shu
one CL GEN book
‘one book’
(2a) yi kuai rou
one piece meat
‘a piece of meat’
(2b) yi kuaide rou
one piece GEN meat
‘a piece of meat’
Tai(1990) points outthatthere isalsoan important semanticdistinction between
the two notions in that classifiers can only classify over a limited and specific group
ofnouns,whilemeasurewordscanbeusedasameasureforawidevarietyofnouns.
His definition isas follows:
A classifier categorizes a class of nouns by picking out some salient perceptual
properties, whether physically or functionally based, which are permanently
associated with the entities named by the class of nouns; a measure word
does not categorize but denotes the quantity of the entity named by a noun.
(1990: 312).

C.-R.Huang,K.Ahrens/LanguageSciences25(2003)353–373 357
For example, in (2b) above, ‘kuai’ is a measure word because it does not pick out
any salient properties of ‘meat’ nor does it categorize a particular type of meat.
‘Ben’, on the other hand, picks out the salient properties of ‘book’ (i.e. a bound
volume with content).
Underlyingtheconceptthataclassifiercategorizesoveraclassofnounsbasedon
permanent perceptual properties is the idea that the basic semantic function of
nouns is to refer to classic individuals. And although it is a main function of classi-
fiers in Mandarin to select individuals, in what follows we will show that it is
inadequate to only view nouns as referring to classic individuals, and that instead
nouns can be coerced by different types of classifiers to refer to kinds and events as
wellastoindividuals.Beforewediscusscoerciontokindandeventtypes(Sections4
and 5), however, we will first explore coercion within the individual reading to
demonstratehowdifferentclassifierscanemphasizedifferentsalientpropertiesofthe
same noun (Section3).
In this study, while acknowledging the conceptual validity of the classifier/
measure dichotomy, our emphasis in on how the ‘classifier’ system correlates with
the semantic properties of a noun. In other words, we follow Lyons (1995) and
simply treat ‘mensural classfiers’ as a sub-category of classifiers. Hence, there is no
need to make any apriori cutoff between the two possiblesub-categories.
2.2. Sourceandscope ofdata
Our data are based on the Mandarin Chinese Classifier Dictionary (Chang et al.,
1994; Huang et al., 1995b). The dictionary itself was compiled based on data from
the Academia Sinica Balanced Corpus of Modern Mandarin Chinese (abbreviated
as Sinica Corpus hereafter). The Sinica corpus is a grammatically tagged and
balancedcorpuscontainingatotaloffivemillionwords(CKIP,1995).Itreflectsthe
Mandarin Chinesespoken inTaiwan.
The dictionary contains definitions and examples of 427 classifier and measure
words. One hundred twenty of these are found in elementary school textbooks and
the other 307were selected based on their high frequency in theSinicaCorpus. The
dictionary also has a second part that lists 1910 noun ending morphemes (and
their associated 12,352 nouns) and lists the classifiers that can co-occur with these
morphemes.
Inthedictionary,theclassifiers andmeasurewordsareclassified intoseventypes.
(The dictionary uses the term liang4ci2 to refer to both classifiers and measure
words.) The first three types correspond to our definition of classifier based on the
syntactic and semantic definitions given in the previous section and that latter four
typescorrespondtomeasurewords.Theseventypesare(1)generalclassifiers(what
wecallindividualclassifiers),(2)eventclassifiers,(3)kindclassifiers,(4)proximation
measure words, (5) container measure words, (6) standard measure words and (7)
activity measure words. There are 174 general classifiers listed in the dictionary, as
well as 35 event classifiers and 14 kind classifiers. In the following section we will
lookathowthegeneralclassifierscancoerceaparticularsemanticreadingbasedon
their semanticproperties.

3. The individual reading
The individual reading is the most common aspect of classifier usage. Previous
work (Tai and Chao, 1994; Ahrens, 1994) has emphasized that the classifier picks
out salient features of the noun. Thus each noun will have associated classifier(s),
thatarelearnedalongwiththatnoun.Forexample,in(3)theclassifiertiaoclassifies
forlong,cylindrical, flexible objects(Taiand Wang,1990).
(3a) yi tiao shenzi
one CL rope
‘rope’
(3b) yi tiao she
one CL snake
‘snake’
(3c) yi tiao yu
one CL fish
‘fish’
(3d) yi tiao shayu
one CL shark
‘shark’
Tai argues that properties entailed in the classifiers can be deduced from examin-
ing the perceptual similarities among nouns that they occur with. For example, in
additiontotheanalysisgiveninTaiandWang(1990)fortiao,TaiandChao(1994)
proposes that zhang classifies over flat, rectangular, two-dimensional, horizontal
objects(i.e. it classifies forpaper, tables,chairs etc.).
Inadditiontooccurringwithclassifiersthatcontainspecificperceptualproperties,
nounscan,inaddition,occurwiththeclassifierge.Thisclassifierhasbeenviewedas
a neutral classifier, because it can occur with nouns of many different semantic
classes. Meyers (2000) argues that ge is more correctly viewed as a semantically
vacuous morpheme that is inserted by a default rule, as opposed to being linked
with nouns through analogy as other classifiers are. This may be the case; how-
ever, Ahrens (1994) demonstrates that the critical point is that the occurrence of
ge (whether by a default rule or by analogy) does not apply uniformly across
nouns.
Herproductionexperimentswithnativespeakersdemonstratethatiftheclassifier
has a unique and elaborative relationship (cf. Langacker, 1987) with its noun, it is
less likely to occur with the neutral classifier ge. On the other hand, the less unique
andelaborativetherelationship,themorelikelytheneutralclassifiergewilloccurin
place ofthemore specific individualclassifier. For example,inanexperiment where
subjects were asked to describe the pictures they saw, tiao occurs with shenzi ‘rope’

83%ofthetime,butoccursonly47%ofthetimewithshe‘snake’,only23%oftime
with ‘fish’ and only 16% of thetimewith ‘shark’.
Ahrens attributes these results to the fact that although ‘snake’ embodies the
qualities of ‘thin, cylindrical and flexible’, and therefore has an elaborative rela-
tionship with its classifier, the animal classifier zhi is competing for occurrence with
thisnoun,andsoitdoesnotinvolveauniquerelationshipwiththenoun.‘Fish’not
only has the animal classifier competing to occur with the classifier zhi, it also does
not necessarily entail the quality of cylindricality. ‘Shark’ has an animal classifier
competingwithtiaoandinaddition,doesnotembody‘thinness’nor‘cylindricality’.
Thus, although the system of individual classifiers is based on cognitive principles,
the occurrence of a noun with a particular classifier is dependent upon the unique-
ness of the relationship with the noun as well as the possibility of other competing
classifiers.
This possibility of other competing classifiers is what we will turn to next. In
addition to individual nouns occurring with the semantically neutral ge, nouns can
alsooccurwithdifferentspecificclassifiers,althoughthisfacthasnotbeenexamined
closely in the previous literature. For example, in (4) the use of the classifier ben is
the usual specific classifier used forbooks.Thereis acontrast, however, inmeaning
between (4a) and (4b).
(4a) Zhangsan mai le san ben shu/bijiben
Zhangsan buy ASP three CL_IN book/notebook
‘‘Zhangsan boughtthree books/notebooks.’’
(4b) Zhangsan mai le san bu shu/*bijiben
Zhangsan buy ASP three CL_IN book/notebook
‘‘Zhangsan boughtthree (different) books/*notebooks.’’
Benreferstoindividualbooks,whilebureferstobothindividualbooksaswellasto
thecontentoftheindividualbooks.Thus,inthecaseof(4a)thethreebooksmay(or
may not) be three copies of ‘‘War and Peace’’, or they may be notebooks when
bijiben ‘notebook’ is used. However, in the case of (4b) it is that the three books
must all differ in terms of their content, as seen from the fact that the classifier bu
cannot occur with bijiben ‘notebook’ because notebooks do not necessarily involve
content.
Another interesting example of individual classifiers creating a semantic type
shifting isgiven in(5).

Bothju4andxian4areindividualclassifiers.However,juselectsmachinerywhilexian4

The selection of a noun by a classifier is limited however. ‘‘Book,’’ for example,
cannot occur with the animal classifier zhi to refer to, for example, books about
animals, or a child’s book in the shape of an animal. The classifier must select a
property of the entire class of nouns, and not just a particular noun. Thus, all tele-
phones have a physical receiver as well as a phone line. All books have a physical
manifestation of paper (or what appears to be paper in a computer) and have con-
tent,whilenotebooksonlynecessarilyhavetheformer.Itistheclassifierthatselects
the relevant properties of thenoun and coerces the appropriatemeaning.
Pustejovsky (1995) proposes the concept of qualia structure to encode a ‘‘set of
semantic constraints by which we understand a word when embedded within the
language’’(p.86).TheseconstraintsmaybeConstitutive,Formal,Telic,orAgentive
andaredefinedasfollows:Constitutiveconstraintsinvolvetherelationshipbetween
an object and its parts and include material, weight and components. Formal con-
straints distinguish the object within a larger domain and involve orientation, mag-
nitude, shape, dimensionality, color and position. Telic constraints involve the
purpose and function of the object, and Agentive constraints are ‘‘the factors
involved in the origin of an object’’ (Pustejovsky 1995: 86). For instance, book is
Constitutively defined to contain information; it is Formally defined to be made of
bound sheets of paper; its Telic constraint defines its typical purpose as being read;
and finally,its Agentiveconstraint states that it iscreated by writing.
Thus we can see that with the noun dianhua ‘telephone’, the classifier ju4 in (5a)
has the Formal role of telephone as an object while the classifier xian in (5b) repre-
sentstheTelicroleoftelephoneasatooltoconnecttotelephonelines.Inthecaseof
shu ‘book’, the classifier ben has the Formal role of a bound volume while the clas-
sifier buinvolvestheConstitutive role ofcompleteand structured knowledge. Thus,
individual classifiers can coerce nominal semantic types, and semantic coercion can
be predicted through awellencoded qualia structure.
In terms of the representation of meaning, Pustejovsky (1995) implies that the
complete qualia structure represents a single nominal sense that facilitates genera-
tion of different interpretations. In our theory (Ahrens et al., 1998), we make the
crucial distinction of allowing a sense to be instantiated as different meaning facets.
These different meaning facets (of the same sense) can be derived either by Puste-
jovsky’s type-shifting rules or Allen’s (1977) pragmatic rules. Following our earlier
attempt to define the unit of sense, our focus of the current study is on how these
disparate semantic objects can be coherently represented as a sense. We assume
without further elaboration that when different semantic types (such as individuals,
setsofindividuals,properties,setsofproperties,etc.)areinvolved,aChierchiaetal.
(1989) style type-shifting rule will apply. However, with or without type-shifting,
contextual information will ‘coerce’ a sense by eliminating other possible inter-
pretationsinarichlyencodedbutunder-specifiedlexicon.Hence,whatisimportant
tousisthefactthat,veryoften,thesemanticshiftingisapplicabletoanentireclass
of nouns (Ahrens et al., 1998). For example, the classifier duo refers to ‘bud’ of a
plant or flower, while zhu refersto theplantitself,as in(6).

C.-R.Huang,K.Ahrens/LanguageSciences25(2003)353–373 361
(6a) yi duo hua
one CL flower/plant
‘one flower’
(6b) yi zhu hua
one CL flower/plant
‘one plant’
This same shifting in instantiated meaning is applicable to all nouns that end in the
morpheme hua ‘flower’, such as meiguihua ‘rose’ or meihua ‘plum flower’, etc. In
these cases, it is differences in the Formal properties of the noun that are being
distinguished.
Wehavedemonstratedabovethatclassifierscancoercenounstohaveaparticular
individual reading depending on the information entailed in the classifier itself. The
classifiercanvaryintheConstitutive,Formal,TelicorAgentiverolesthatitcarries.
The classifier then forces the noun to undergo a semantic type-shifting, so that the
salient properties that the classifier entails are then viewed as the salient properties
of that noun (even if they weren’t viewed as salient previously).
In what follows we will show that this semantic type-shifting is not limited to the
individual reading of nouns. Classifiers can also type-shift nouns to a kind reading
and to an event reading.
4. The kind reading

of the nominal semantic features picked by the classifier. In fact, we will show that
there is a whole set of different kind classifiers selecting different semantic kinds. In
other words, this is a case where a sub-system of classifiers is devoted to the classi-
fication of the concept of kinds. This fact suggests that kind is treated as a primary
semantic type that is ascribed to nominals and allows sub-typing selection by clas-
sifiers. Thus the Mandarin classifier system will offer the first known evidence that
the semantic notion ofkind is grammaticalized in alanguage.
Inadditiontothemostlycommonlyusedzhong3,13additionalkindclassifiersare
listed inTable1.
All these kind classifiers have the following common grammatical characteristic:
they select a broad class of nouns, unlike the highly idiosyncratic selection of the
individualclassifiers.Semantically,thisfollowsfromthefactthatkindclassifiersselect
thekindsrepresentedbynouns,nottheindividualsreferredbythem.Hence,thenat-

Thekindclassifiersintheabovesixinstancescanbereplacedbytheneutralclassifier
zhong3, but not by the neutral individual classifier ge. This further supports the
position that kind classifiers form a semantically motivated grammatical class by
themselves and are different from individual classifiers. Moreover, like other
Mandarinclassifiers, theinstancesofkindclassifiersthatwe givein(8)–(13)involve
the numeral-classifier construction, which shows that kinds are individuated and
enumerated.
4.2. The bareNP reading
Bare NPs in Mandarin Chinese have a wide range of possible interpretations.
Among these interpretations thekind reading isone ofthe most difficult toaccount
for(see example14 below).
(14) gou bi mao da
dog compare cat big
‘‘Dogsare bigger than cats. [preferred reading]’’
OR ‘‘This dog isbigger than this cat.’’

364 C.-R.Huang,K.Ahrens/LanguageSciences25(2003)353–373
With the kind reading exemplified in (14), the NPs do not refer to any specific indi-
vidual, nor do they refer to all instances in within the species. Hence (14) does not
logically entail that a specific dog is bigger than a specific cat, contrary to the pre-
diction of an account where the bare NP refers to either an individual animal or
some subset of the animals. What is interesting is the additional reading. It says a
specific dog is bigger than a specific cat. This is an impossible interpretation for the
(English) generic reading. However, if we take the kind reading in Chinese as pick-
ing up the contextually defined subset of individual(s) to which the noun applies,
thenitispossibletoseecontextswhereexactlyoneindividualwillbepicked.Hence
the individualreading can be uniformly accountedfor (Huang,1987).
The same semantic effect is achieved when the kind interpretation is marked by a
classifier. Although the kind reading is previously thought to be one of the generic
readings typical of bare nominals (Carlson, 1977; Chierchia, 1982), this reading can
also occurwiththe kind classifier in Mandarin asshownin (15).
(15) zhe zhong ma zaihuabei hen changjian
this CLS_KD horse atChina-north verycommon-seen
‘‘Thiskind of horse isvery commonly seenin Northern China.’’
(Huang, 1987).
The sentence in example (15) does not entail that any specific individual horse of
the referred kind is in north China, nor does it entail that a majority of this kind of
horse is there. Its interpretation is that a contextually defined subset of this parti-
cular kind of horses is commonly seen in north China. In addition, this data casts
doubt on a structural account, such as in the Government and Binding framework
(e.g. Tang, 1990), where classifiers are assigned to the Specifier position; since whe-
ther the Specifier position is lexically filled or not can no longer be a test of the
specificity/definiteness ofthe NP.4
The fact that (16) below serves as a paraphrase of (14) also supports our obser-
vation that the existence of classifiers such as zhong3 achieve the same semantic
effect ofkindreading.

The free variation of Mandarin bare nominals between kind and individual read-
ings is accounted for with type-shifting (Huang, 1987; Chierchia et al., 1989). It is

example,inCantoneseaclassifierisnecessarybutnotsufficientforaspecificinterpretation.However,in

thewsandPacioni,1997).

C.-R.Huang,K.Ahrens/LanguageSciences25(2003)353–373 365
interesting to observe, however, that the use of the classifier zhong3 in (15) and (16)
entails that there is obligatory type-shifting and the sentence is unambiguously
interpreted as a kind reading.
In sum, we have shown in this section that kind classifiers form an integral class
within the Mandarin classifier system. They individuate and classify the different
kind readings that can be obtained from nominal semantics. Thus we have shown
that the notion of kind is not only crucial to theories of nominal semantics, but is
also attested by the grammatical system ofa natural language.
5. The event reading
In this section we will show that the Mandarin classifier system contains a sub-
class that selects another theoretically significant entity: i.e. event-type entities.
Chierchia (1982) was one of the first semanticists to propose that events and activ-
ities could be referred to as entities. He studied nominalization and the English
gerund system and demonstrated that the grammatical system marks the type-
shifting from events to event-type entities (i.e. names of the events.) In (17), that
the gerund ‘‘seeing’’ refers to a certain type of event as is obvious from its verbal
derivation.
(17) Seeing isbelieving.
ThusthesemanticsofnominalizationistreatedbyChierchiaasaninstanceoftype-
shifting which individuates the events. In Mandarin, however, not only is no
morpho-lexical marking involved when the event-type nominal is deverbal, it is
also possible to coerce an event type reading from a noun without any deriva-
tion. We will show in this section that the event classifiers coerce just such an
effect. Since there will be no marking on the nouns, it is necessary to develop tests
for event-type entities to prove that the classifier-noun phrase does have an event
reading.
It should be noted that event-type nominals have eventive semantics, including
event structures. The semantic (not syntactic) nature of events is that they are tem-
porally anchored, and that they take arguments. Thus, the semantic tests we have
for event-type nominals are that they occur as temporal delimiters, and that they
allow oblique arguments. Two additional syntactic tests are that they satisfy the
subcategorization requirement of predicates which take event-type arguments, and
that they cannotbe replaced by theneutral individualclassifier ge.
First,anevent cannottakeplacewithoutatimeframe,eitheratemporalpointof
itsoccurrenceora(relative)timedurationofitsexistence.Thus,temporalreference
is an integral part of the semantics of events, including event-type nominals. The
individual classifiers, on the other hand, do not carry temporal reference in their
semantics. Thus, an important grammatical characteristic of event-type nominals is
that they co-occur with a temporal subordinator, such as yi3hou4 ‘after’ (without
any predicates) to establish the temporal (and causal) sequence of events; (18a)

366 C.-R.Huang,K.Ahrens/LanguageSciences25(2003)353–373
shows how such a temporal sequence is established with a full clause. In (18b) we
show that when the classifier tang4 is used, the noun taijiquan ‘‘TaiChi boxing’ can
refer to theeventwithoutany overt verbal predicate.
(18a) dale taijiquan yihouta shenti shufu duo le
playLE Tai_Chi after s/he body comfortable more LE
‘‘S/he feels much betterafterdoingTai Chi.’’
(18b) san tang taijiquan yihou ta shenti shufu duo le
three CLS_EV Tai-Chi after s/he body comfortable more PERF
‘‘S/he feels much betterafter(performing)three rounds of TaiChi.’’
Second, it is well-known that event-type nominals preserve their argument
structure and take (oblique) arguments, such as the English possessive ‘‘John’s pro-
motion’’ or ‘‘Mary’s leaving early’’. In Mandarin, a deverbal noun can take a pos-
sessive (encliticized with de), or preceding oblique arguments, such as the underlined
NP in (19).
(19) Zhangsan dui Lisi de jianyi
Zhangsan TO Lisi DE suggestion
‘‘Zhangsan’s suggestion/advice forLisi (i.e. Zhangsan advised Lisi)’’
In (20), we show that when an event classifier is used, the nominal head takes an
event reading and thepossessor isinterpreted as an argument ofthe head.
(20) zhongtong de yitong dianhua
president DE oneCLS_EVtelephone
‘‘A call from the President (i.e. the President madethe phone call)’’
Last,itcanbeshowninMandarinthattheeventreadingisselectedbyafewsmall
classes of verbs, such as light verbs jin4xing2 ‘‘to proceed’’ (Huang et al., 1995a,b),
happenstance verbs fa1sheng1 ‘‘to happen’’, and event-evaluation verbs hua1 ‘‘to
cost’’. For instance, hua1 takes a nominal subject that refers directly to an event
(21a), or aclause describingan event(21b).
(21a) xishi hen hua qian
happy-event very cost money
‘‘Weddings cost a lot.’’
(21b) jiehun hen hua qian
marryverycost money
‘‘It costs a lot to getmarried.’’

C.-R.Huang,K.Ahrens/LanguageSciences25(2003)353–373 367
In (22), we show that the same semantic selection can be satisfied when an event
classifier is used. Thus, it supports our position that event classifiers selects event-
type nominals.
(22) zhechang dianyingbu hua qian
thisCLS_EV movie NEG cost money
‘‘It did notcostany money to seethis movie.’’

bare NP, similarly toexample (21a).
(23) dianying hen hua qian
movie verycostmoney
‘‘It isvery expensive (to make/finance/watch/...) movies’’
However, when a bare NP is type-shifted to an eventive reading, the actual event is
underspecified and may have a wide range of interpretations whereas in (22), we
showedthatwhentheeventmeaningiscoercedbyaclassifier,italsodeterminesthe
event-type. In other words, the semantic coercion fits the classical description of
what aclassifier does. The eventclassifiers force the event reading by classifyingthe
eventintoaspecifictype.In(22),chang3referstoscheduledandregularlyoccurring

5.1. Eventclassifiers and their semantics
Pustejovsky’s (1995) theory of a Generative Lexicon proposes that the semantics
of nouns cannot be completely represented without referring to two different event-
structuresencodedinthequaliastructureofeachlexicalentry.TheAgentiveroleof
a noun is defined in terms of an event structure describing how this noun ‘‘origi-
nated’’. The Telic role is defined in terms of an event structure describing the func-
tion of the noun. His point is that polysemy cannot be accounted for if these two
aspectsof a noun are not considered.
Adopting Pustejovsky’s position, the fact that certain classifiers can coerce event
readings from nouns that are typically interpreted as individuals is not surprising,
since their semantic representation already contains event structure information.
Since these event structures are idiosyncratically encoded, we also correctly predict
that the selection between event classifiers and their nominal heads are more
restrictive than kind classifiers. We will further classify the event classifiers into the
event-type classifiers, which individuate different event structures, and the event-
token classifiers, which individuateeach occurrence of an event.

Table2
Eventclassifiers
Huangetal.(1995a,b)list35classifiersaseventclassifiers.TheyarelistedinTable2.
Among these event classifiers, the event-type classifiers are more specialized since
theyselectaparticulareventtype. For instance, the event-type classifier chu1 selects
the nouns which contains the stems of either ju2 ‘‘drama’’ in (24a) or xi4 ‘‘play’’ in
(24b).

C.-R.Huang,K.Ahrens/LanguageSciences25(2003)353–373 369
(24a) shashibiya daodi yigong xiele ji chu xi?
Shakespeare eventuallytogether write-PREF how_many CLS_EV play
‘‘Howmany plays did Shakespeare write all together?’’
(24b) bailaohui jin nian zhi yan le yi chu gewuju
Broadway this yearonly play PERF one CLS_EV musical
‘‘Onlyonemusical(e.g.Cats)wasperformedonBroadwayallyearthisyear.’’
The two sentences above have Agentive (24a) and Telic (24b) readings respectively,
suggesting that these event readings are coerced from the Pustejovskian qualia
structure.TheAgentivereadingof(24a)specificallyreferstotheeventtypesofhow
a play comes into being. The Telic reading of (24b) refers specifically to the event
types of why a play is produced (to be viewed). They also clearly show that chu1
individuates event-types.
Incontrast,when anevent-tokenclassifier isused, thesamenoun willrefertothe
occurrences of the event. The event-token classifier chang3 selects a scheduled event
as in(25).
(25) bailaohui jin nian gong yanle yibai chang gewuju
Broadway this yeartogether playPERF one hundred CLS_EVmusical
‘‘Broadway had one hundred performances of musicals this year.’’
Thus (25) claims that musicals were performed 100 times on Broadway without
referring to whether the same play was shown or not, while (24b) claims that only
one musicalwas performed withoutclaiming to howmany times it was done so.
Even though event-types and event-tokens are semantically distinct entities and
the classification is supported by the two unambiguous cases given above (24b and
25), we do find that in many cases the same classifier will be polysemous with both
event-type(26a) and event token readings (26b).
(26a) Changrong you shi ban feiji fei gaoxiung
EVA has tenCLS_EV airplane fly Kaohsiung
‘‘EVA has tenscheduledflightstoKaohsiung .’’
(26b) Changrong gang feizou le san ban feiji
EVA just fly-awayPERF three CLS_EV airplane
‘‘Three EVA flights just took off.’’
Example (26a) has the event structure of ‘‘flights’’, while (26b) individuates each
particular flight.
In sum, our semantic account of the event classifiers in this section suggests that
event classifiers can adopt the event information encoded in qualia structures to

370 C.-R.Huang,K.Ahrens/LanguageSciences25(2003)353–373
define both Agentive and Telic roles and coerce the semantics into agentive or telic
events. We also have shown that the semantics of event classifiers can be further
distinguished as referring toeither theeventtype oreventtokens.
6. Conclusion
We have demonstrated above that it is inadequate to view the ontology of the
classifier system asbasedontheclassicnotion ofindividuals.Weargueinsteadthat
thetopleveloftheontologyoftheMandarinChineseclassifiersystemisactuallytri-
partite: individual, kind, and event. An important motivation in studying this new
ontology of the Mandarin Chinese classifier system is the fact that even seemingly
straightforward referential nominals have complex semantic content, as suggested
by our data as well as recent studies on nominal lexical semantics which refer to
different individual or events (Pustejovsky, 1993, 1995). In fact, the semantics of
nouns are more complicated than one might suspect. As we have shown above,
Mandarin Chinese offers one of the most dramatic illustrations since its nouns can
have very different meanings without any additional morphological markings. Our
main generalization is summarized below. Three of the possible meanings of the
noundian4hua4‘‘telephone’’andoffei1ji1‘‘airplane’’canbebroughtoutbytheuse
of different classifiers, asgivenin Tables 3and 4respectively.
Theindividualclassifiers juandxiancanselect oneoftwointerpretationsrelating
to the ‘phone’. The former selects the telephone machinery itself, while the latter
selectsthelineforthephone,asin‘lineone’or‘linetwo’.Thekindclassifiercoerces
a kind reading so that a particular type of phone (i.e. cordless or cell phone) is
referred to. The event classifier coerces an eventive reading and refers to the com-
pleted actof calling.

The implications for this new tripartite classification of classifiers are three-fold:
first, it explains why the kind reading in Mandarin Chinese, while it can be under-
stood as a generic reading typical of bare nominals, also occurs with a subset of
classifiers(i.e.thekindclassifiers)andisasemantictypeinandofitself.Second,the
previously abstract semantic distinctions between kinds, individuals and events are
nowfound tobe instantiatedinoneparticular system (i.e. theclassifier system)ofa
naturallanguagegrammar,andmoreover,thesethreeclassifiertypeshavetheirown
taxonomic system. Thus, this suggests that the semantic types of individuals, kinds
and events are useful categorizing tools for humans (and not just formal semanti-
cists), and that these concepts are encoded on a cognitive level. Finally, this classi-
fication allows us to a take a fresh look at the complex semantic contents of nouns,
and at theinteraction and coercion that takes place between classifiers and nouns.
In future studies, we hope our findings will help us to better understand the
interaction of semantic meanings among kinds, individuals, and generics (Carlson
andPelletier,1995;Chierchia,1994).Inparticular,basedonthereadyavailabilityof
the kind reading, either with bare plurals in all languages or with kind classifiers in
Chinese,wesuspectthatthekindroleshouldbepartofthenominalqualiastructure
in the theory of a Generative Lexicon. With regard to the event readings of nom-
inals, even though the present theory of qualia structure does offer an possible
accountofhowthesereadingscanbeobtainedfromthelexicalsemanticsofthenom-
inals,morethoroughstudiesareneededinordertoshedlightonwhethertheAgentive
and Telic events are the only events that are necessarily encoded in the nominal
semantics, as well as additional studies on how these event readings are selected.
Lastly, as Alexandra Aikhenvald has pointed out (p.c. August 2001) event-type
classifiers in other languages have been described, although the term event may not

372 C.-R.Huang,K.Ahrens/LanguageSciences25(2003)353–373
havebeenused[e.g.Aikhenvald’s(2000)discussionofuseofclassifierswithabstract
nouns (pp. 335–336)]. It would be interesting to examine if these instances do fall
underevent-type classifiers as we havedefined them in this paper.
Moreover, if they do, do these languages also have a kind classifier system (in
additionofcoursetoanindividualclassifiersystem)?Thatis,towhatextentarethe
semantic concepts of individual, kind and event instantiated in the grammars of
other language’sclassifiers systems?
