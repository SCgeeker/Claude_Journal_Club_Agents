share genealogical descent. Here, we suggest that the geographic distribution of features
globally can be explained by two major pathways, which are generally not distinguished
within quantitative typological models: feature diffusion and language expansion. The first
pathwaycorrespondstothecontactscenariodescribedabove,whilethesecondoccurswhen

systems, such as classifiers, are almost equally widespread, but the former spread more by
language expansion historically, whereas the latter spread more by feature diffusion. Our
results indicate that quantitative models measuring the areal diffusibility and stability of
linguistic features are likely to be affected by language expansion that occurs by historical
coincidence. We anticipate that our findings will support studies of language diversity in a
more sophisticated way, with relevance to other parts of language, such as phonology.
