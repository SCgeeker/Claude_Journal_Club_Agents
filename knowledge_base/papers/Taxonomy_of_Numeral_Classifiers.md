Taxonomy of Numeral Classifiers:
A Formal Semantic Proposal
Jiun-Shiung Wu and One-Soon Her
<abstract>
In a numeral classifier language, a classifier (C) or measure word
(M) is needed to link a noun (N) and its numerical quantifier (Num). This
paper first illustrates the confusions surrounding the convergence and
divergence between Cs and Ms and offers some clarification. From the
multiplicative mathematical perspective proposed in Greenberg
(1990[1972]: 172), Au Yeung (2007), and Her (2012a), C and M converge
as the multiplicand, with Num as the multiplier. Yet, crucially, a C’s value
is numerical and necessarily 1, while an M’s value can be anything but 1,
thus ¬1. An M’s value can therefore be numerical, e.g., 2, 6, 12, etc., or
non-numerical, e.g., kilo, meter, liter, bottle, etc. This paper then proposes
a new and comprehensive taxonomy based on the different kinds of
mathematical values encoded in C/Ms and further proposes a formal
semantic account of this taxonomy.
Keywords: formal semantics, classifier, measure word, multiplicand, 1,
¬1
1. Introduction
In a numeral classifier language like Chinese, when a noun (N) is quantified by a numeral
(Num), a classifier (C) or measure word (M) is often needed, as in (1a) and (1b), respectively.
Note that C and M appear in exactly the same syntactic position and are in complementary
distribution, as shown in (2).
(1) a. san tiao yu
3 C fish
‘3 fish’
b. san xiang yu
3 M-box fish
‘3 boxes of fish’
1

(2) a.*san tiao xiang yu
b.*san xiang tiao yu
This fact suggests that C and M in a classifier language form a single syntactic category,
which we shall dub ‘C/M’. This C/M convergence view is shared by many linguists, e.g.,
Hass (1942), Emeneau (1951), D. Nguyen (1957), Chao (1968), Becker (1975), Li &
Thompson (1981), Huang (1982), Hundias & Kolver (1983), Craig (1994), Lin (1997),
Cheng & Sybesma (1998, 1999), M. Hsieh (2008), among many others, where various
arguments have been constructed to support this view (see Her 2012b for a summary). Most
standard dictionaries, grammar books, and language textbooks of classifier languages also do
not make any formal distinction between the two. However, as likewise noted by numerous
linguists, Cs and Ms are also very different. This following informal characterization by Tai
& Wang (1990: 38) is an often-cited example:
A classifier categorizes a class of nouns by picking out some salient perceptual properties,
either physically or functionally based, which are permanently associated with entities named
by the class of nouns; a measure word does not categorize but denotes the quantity of the
entity named by noun. (Tai & Wang 1990: 38)
The undeniable fact that Ms quantify the head noun, but Cs must qualify the noun in
terms of certain semantic features has compelled many researchers to claim that C and M are
two distinct semantic and/or syntactic categories, e.g., Greenberg (1990[1972]), Tai & Wang
(1990), Tai (1994), Her & Hsieh (2010), X. Li (2011, 2012), Zhang (2011), among many
others. T. Nguyen (2004: vii), for example, is emphatic that ‘classifiers and measure phrases,
often treated as belonging to a single category in prior literature, are shown to be
2

fundamentally distinct.’ Likewise, various arguments have been constructed to support this
divergence view (also see Her 2012b for a summary).
The fact that C and M seem to converge and diverge at the same time has long put
linguists in a quandary. In practice, most of the syntactic works, especially the more recent
ones in the generative framework, e.g., Tang (2005), M. Hsieh (2008), Huang et al (2009),
Her (2012b), A. Li (2014), to name just a few, take C and M to be a single category, some
explicitly and others implicitly, even though, as H. Zhang (2007:45) observes, ‘Chinese
linguists generally agree that a distinction between these two kinds should be made.’ Wang
(1994: 19-20) complains that ‘previous works in Chinese grammar treat classifiers and
measure words on an equal footing’ and proclaims that ‘it is essential to tell classifiers from
measure words both semantically and syntactically’. N. Zhang (2009) also observes that ‘the
relation between classifiers and measure words has baffled linguists for a long time’ and
subsequently proposes in (N. Zhang 2011, 2013) that C and M constitute two different
categories in both syntactic and semantic terms. Yet, even for those that explicitly claim that
C and M should be distinguished, the criteria proposed are often informal and imprecise. The
quote from Tai & Wang (1990: 38) given above is a good example.
An added confusion in this already confused state of affairs is the issue whether classifier
languages like Chinese make a lexical distinction of mass and count. While many, e.g., Cheng
& Sybesma (1998), Tang (2005), M. Hsieh (2008), Her & Hsieh (2010), Yi (2009, 2011), Her
(2012a), among others, assume such a distinction in Chinese and contend that C requires a
lexical count noun but M does not, many others, e.g., Quine (1969), Allan (1977), Hanson
(1983), Link (1991), Lucy (1992), Krifka (1995), Chierchia (1998a), Mou (1999), Toyota
(2009), and Toyota et al (2012), insist that the fact that C/M is required for Num to quantify
N means that N can only be mass in such languages.
3

In this paper we aim to accomplish three things. First, we will follow Her (2012a) in
interpreting the convergence and divergence between Cs and Ms from a mathematical
perspective and further argue that C/M as a single syntactic category can be classified into
different subtypes in terms of their mathematical values. Thus, Her and Lin’s (2015) formal
taxonomy of various subtypes under C/M will be discussed and supported. Second, we shall
offer a formal semantic account for the C/M unification as well as the various types in the
C/M taxonomy. Third, we will demonstrate that in carrying out the above two goals it is
necessary to assume a lexical mass/count distinction in classifier languages. This position
then leads to the conclusion that such a distinction is universal.
The paper is organized into six sections. Section 2 offers a brief description of the current
confused state of affairs in the study of Cs and Ms and provides some clarification. Section 3
first reviews the similarities and difference between Cs and Ms, and then accounts for such
convergence and divergence with a new taxonomy of C/Ms based on an insight from a
mathematical perspective, where C/Ms are viewed as multiplicands with various kinds of
values. Section 4 proposes a formal semantic account of Cs and various subtypes of Ms.
Section 5 demonstrates that the taxonomy and the semantics proposed in this paper are
evidence for a universal mass/count distinction at the lexical level. Section 6 consists of a
summary and some concluding remarks.
2. A Confused State of Affairs
As noted by some researchers, e.g., H. Zhang (2007: 45) and Her (2012a: 1669), the
uncertain status of Cs and Ms is reflected in the often confusing terminology used in the
literature. Terms used for C include ‘classifier’, ‘count-classifier’, ‘count-noun classifier’,
‘individual classifier’, ‘qualifying classifier’, and ‘sortal classifier’; those for M include
‘measure word’, ‘mass-classifier’, ‘mass-noun classifier’, ‘massifier’, ‘mensural classifier’,
4

‘measural classifier’, and ‘quantifier’. This list is not meant to be exhaustive. Further to the
confusion, many also use the term ‘classifier’, ‘numeral classifier’, or ‘quantifier’ for C/M as
a single category, and some others use the term ‘measure word’, ‘measure’, ‘unit word’, or
‘numerative’ instead for the same purpose. Most of the papers or books published in Chinese
use the term 量詞liangci ‘measure word’ to refer to the category of C/M, while a small
number of them do clearly distinguish between 分類詞 fenleici or 類別詞 leibieci
‘classifier’ and liangci ‘measure word’. In this paper we use the term ‘C/M’ to refer to the
unified category of the elements between Num and N; the construction is referred to as [Num
C/M N]. ‘C’ is strictly for ‘classifiers’ (or ‘sortal classifiers’) and ‘M’ strictly for ‘measure
words’ (or ‘mensural classifiers’ or ‘massifiers’). Explicit criteria for this distinction will be
discussed in section 3.
Another symptom of the confused state of affairs, as noted by Her & Hsieh (2012: 128),
is the drastically different inventories of ‘classifiers’, or linagci, compiled by different
researchers for Mandarin Chinese, ranging from as few as fifty-one (Chao 1968) and several
dozen (Erbaugh 2002), to one hundred and twenty-six (Gao & Malt 2009), to two hundred
(Hung 1996), to four hundred and twenty-seven (Huang & Ahrens 2003), to as many as many
as six hundred (Hu 1993). These different numbers no doubt reflect very different ideas as to
what belongs to this category, and even for those that do make a clear distinction between Cs
and Ms, there is confusion over what counts as a C exactly. To the best of our knowledge, Lai
(2011) and Her & Lai (2012) on Mandarin, Chen (2013) and Chen et al (to appear) on
Taiwanese southern Min, and Liao (2014) on Taiwanese Hakka are the only three works in
the literature that offer a comprehensive list of Cs in a classifier language that is based on
explicit and testable criteria.
The problem is thus two-fold: how to precisely and insightfully distinguish C and M and
yet also unify C/M at the same time. Previous accounts fall short one way or another.
5

Accounts that treat C and M as one formal category typically lack precise or formal
distinction between the two subcategories, e.g., Hsieh (2008), Huang et al (2009), A. Li
(2014), to name just a few. Li & Thompson (1981: 106) famously claim that ‘any measure
word can be a classifier.’ On the other hand, in works that do offer a distinction between C
and M, the distinction is typically stated informally and there is also a lack of account for C
and M’s formal convergence. Examples abound; here we discuss several examples from
prominent works, starting with a classic, Chao (1968: 584-620), where Cs are referred to as
‘classifiers’, ‘individual measures’, or ‘Mc’ in short, and considered one out of eight types
within the category of nominal measure words.1
(3) Chao’s (1968:584-620) Classification of Measure Words
1. Mc (Classifiers, or Individual Measures):
e.g., 一個人 yige ren ( 1 C person) ‘one person’
2. Mc’ (Classifiers Associated with V-O):
e.g., 惹一場禍 re yichang huo (cause 1 C disaster) ‘cause a disaster’
3. Mg (Group Measures):
e.g., 一行字 yihang zi (1 line character) ‘one line of characters’
4. Mp (Partitive Measures):
e.g., 一堆土 yidui tu (1 pile dirt) ‘one pile of dirt’
5. Mo (Container Measures):
e.g., 一鍋麵 yiguo mian (1 pot noodle) ‘one pot of noodles’
6. Mt (Temporary Measures):
e.g., 一頭百髮 yitou baifa (1 head white-hair) ‘a headful of white hairs’
7. Mm (Standard Measures):
6

e.g., 一尺布 yichi bu ‘one meter of cloth’
8. Mq (Quasi-Measures, or Autonomous Measures):
e.g., 一釐 yili or 一趴 yipa ‘one percent’
The fundamental disadvantage associated with this taxonomy is that the eight types are all
disjoint and allow no intersecting natural classes. For example, a group measure, a container
measure, and a quasi-measure that has a standardized value, e.g., 打 da ‘dozen’, 茶匙
chichi ‘teaspoon’, and釐 li ‘%’, respectively, can of course also be seen as a standard
measure. Further, any measure word of any type currently without a standardized value can
easily take on a standardized value, be it permanently or temporally, among a small
population or a large population, and thus become a standard measure. The fact that the
different types intersect means that having them as disjoint misses the essential purpose of
taxonomy.
The same weakness is seen in Aikhenvald (2000: 115-117), a seminal work on classifiers,
where she distinguishes between ‘(numeral) classifiers’ (a term for both ‘sortal classifiers’
and ‘measural classifiers’) and ‘measure words’ (a term exchangeable with ‘quantifiers’ and
‘quantifying expressions’) in classifier languages, based on the observation that classifiers
use the unit provided by a noun, while quantifiers, or quantifying expressions, establish the
unit to be counted. Under her view, ‘classifiers’, ‘sortal’ and ‘mensural’, must co-occur with
count nouns, while ‘measure words’ appear with count or mass nouns. Consider the examples
in (4).
(4) san zhi/shuang/xiang/jin xie
3 C/M-pair/M-box/M-kilo shoe
‘3 shoes/3 pairs/boxes/kilos of shoes’
7

In spite of their identical syntactic position, zhi ‘C’, shuang ‘pair’, xiang ‘box’, and jin
‘kilo’ are seen as a sortal classifier, mensural classifier, quantifier, and quantifier, respectively.
The former two are ‘classifiers’, but the latter two are excluded. Such exclusion misses
important generalizations of C/M as a single category and is also in conflict with the view
shared by most grammarians, that shuang ‘pair’, xiang ‘box’, and jin ‘kilo’ are all Ms, or
mensural classifiers.
S. Huang (2013), an important recent work on Chinese grammar, where an entire chapter
is devoted to numeral classifiers, claims to follow Aikhenvald’s (2000) distinction of ‘sortal’
and ‘mensural’ classifiers; furthermore, his distinction is also essentially the same as that of
Tai & Wang (1990: 38):
In the following discussion we will ignore Chao's types (7) and (8), since they do not represent
what I take to be true classifiers in the strict sense of the term. I will for the time being
distinguish just two basic types of NC for nominal classifiers, more or less following
Aikhenvald (2000), sortal classifiers and mensural classifiers. A sortal classifier is one which
individuates a referent in terms of its more inherent properties such as animacy, shape, or
consistency. Mensural classifiers are used for measuring more temporary state of an object, its
quantity, or the arrangement it occurs in. …Note that sortal classifiers and mensural classifiers
are to be distinguished from ordinary measure words such as jin (斤) in yijin tang. (S. Huang
2013: 167-168)
S. Huang’s (2013) rejection of Chao’s type 7, or standard measures like jin ‘catty, kilo’
and 尺 chi ‘meter’, as mensural classifiers is puzzling. Standard measures after all occupy
exactly the same syntactic position as other C/Ms, e.g., zhi ‘C’, shuang ‘pair’, and xiang ‘box’
in (4), and serve the same function to measure the noun. The exclusion of Chao’s type 8, i.e.,
8

quasi-measures, is also unnecessary, as these are simply standard measures of portion that
often appear without a head noun.
The final taxonomy we shall briefly review is found in N. Zhang (2013), where seven
types of ‘unit words’, or C/Ms in our term, are recognized: individual (e.g., 枝 zhi),
individuating (e.g., 滴 di), kind (e.g., 種 zhong), container (e.g., 瓶 ping), standard (e.g.,
斤 jin), partitive (e.g., 段 duan), and collective (e.g., 群 qun). In spite of the apparent
resemblance with Chao’s taxonomy, there are several noteworthy differences. First, N. Zhang
rightly ignores Chao’s type 2, classifiers associated with V-O, as such classifiers easily
appear in non-object positions, and Chao’s type 8, quasi-measures, which, as shown earlier,
can be seen as standard measures. Second, N. Zhang (2013: 212) contends that Chao’s type 6,
or temporary measures, can be seen as container measures or nouns. Third, N. Zhang includes
kind classifiers as a separate type, which is rather reasonable. The fourth difference is more
important: Chao’s type 4, partitive measures, is divided into two types, partitive and
individuating. An individuating unit word must select nouns that are not delimitable, but a
partitive unit word can select either delimitable or undelimitable nouns. A delimitable noun is
atomic, while an undelimitable noun has no intrinsic shape, size, or boundaries.
Note that N. Zhang makes an extraordinary, and likely to be controversial, claim that
container, standard, partitive, and collective unit words have a left-branching structure, but
individual, individuating, and kind unit words have a right-branching structure. The seven
types thus in effect form two formally distinct categories, as shown in Table 1.
Table 1. Taxonomy of C/Ms Derived from Zhang (2013)
9

Category Type Examples
Container 瓶 ping, 箱 xiang
Measures Standard 斤jin, 尺 chi
(left-branching) Partitive 段 duan, 節 jie
Collective 群 qun, 打 da
Individual 枝 zhi, 朵 duo
Classifiers
Individuating 滴 di, 灘 tan
(right-branching)
Kind 種 zhong, 類 lei
This dichotomy has serious implications. Assigning the individual Cs and the
individuating Cs to the same category is inconsistent with the fact that the former requires
delimitable nouns and the latter, undelimitable nouns. On the other hand, assigning the
individual Cs and collective Ms to two different categories misses the generalization that they
both require delimitable nouns. More importantly, this dichotomy predicts that the
left-branching measures and right-branching classifiers need not follow the same word order
in a language. We should thus expect to find that the two distinct categories deviate in word
order in some languages. Yet, Greenberg (1990[1975]: 228) claims that Cs and Ms do not
deviate in word order in any classifier language. In an ongoing research project headed by the
first author, in a database of over 500 classifier languages, no evidence is found that Cs and
Ms differ in word order in any of them. In addition, in all these languages, in a nominal
phrase that consists of a Num and an N, either a C or an M is used, never both. C and M are
always in complimentary distribution. These facts are disconfirming to N. Zhang’s
dichotomy, and suggest strongly that C and M belong to the same category and occupy the
same structural position.2
10

Last but not the least, it is crucial to distinguish between the formal syntactic category of
C/M, as defined by the construction [Num C/M N], and the function they serve, for there is
unfortunately a prevailing confusion over whether certain types of Cs or Ms are in fact
universally available in all languages. The simple fact is that classifier languages like Chinese
employ C/M as a syntactic category, while non-classifier languages like English have the
functional equivalent of such words but do not distinguish a C/M category formally. Many
linguists make the misleading claim that measure words, or mass-classifiers, are a mundane
part of all natural languages, and only sortal classifiers, or count-classifiers, are unique to
classifier languages like Chinese and Japanese, and are not a part of English grammar except
in rare cases such as five head of lettuce (e.g., Allan 1977: 285-86, Croft 1994: 151-152, Tai
1994: 481, Wang 1994: 1, Aikhenvald 2000: 115, Her & Hsieh 2010: 528, among many
others). N. Zhang (2013: 246) and Croft (1994: 151-152) claim specifically that standard
measures (e.g., kilo in five kilos of apples), container measures (e.g., bottle in three bottles of
milk), kind CL (kind in three kinds of chocolate), partitive CLs (e.g., section in three sections
of orange), and collective CLs (e.g., group in three groups of students) are universally
available, but individuating CLs and individual CLs exist only in classifier languages. Such a
view seriously confuses function with form. Worse still is Toyota’s (2009: 120) use of the
term classifier in his claim that English has numerous classifiers. In the quote below, PDE
stands for Present-day English.3
The use of classifiers with the mass noun is quite common in PDE, as in a piece of furniture,
an item of clothing, etc. There may be numerous classifies in PDE, but typical examples used
for the analysis in this paper are listed in (5).
(5) an article of clothing; a blade of grass; a block of ice; a bit of information; a bunch of
grapes; a cake of soap; a cut of meat; a drop of water; an ear of corn; a grain of corn; an
item of clothing; a leaf of sage; a loaf of bread; a lot of water; a piece of information; a
11

sheet of paper; a slice of bacon; a speck of dust; a stick of chalk; a strip of land; a suit of
clothing
(Toyota 2009: 120)
None of the words of measure in the above quote is the Chinese-style M, nor C. In a
non-classifier language, there can of course be words of measure, e.g., kilo, bottle, section,
group, etc. in English, which have the semantic function identical to that of Ms in a classifier
language, e.g., the corresponding jin, ping, jie, qun, etc. in Chinese (e.g., Lyons 1977: 464,
Croft 1994: 152, Löbel 2000: 223). However, formally since there is no (overt) structural
position for C in English or other non-classifier languages, there can be no such position for
M.4 There can thus be no Ms in English, not in the same formal sense as in Chinese or other
classifier languages. Words of measure in English in fact behave as Ns, and nothing like Ms
in Chinese (e.g., Lehrer 1986; Van Riemsdijk 1998; Aikhenvald 2000; Löbel 2000; Borer
2005; Kayne 2005a). As shown in (5), the word of measure box must pluralize like a noun
and its complement must be introduced by a PP, not a bare NP. Its syntactic category and
structural position in (5) are exactly identical to those in (6) and (7), where box behaves as a
mundane common noun.
(5) a. three boxes of chocolate
b.*three box of chocolate
c.*three boxes chocolate
(6) a. three boxes of excellent quality
b.*three box of excellent quality
c.*three boxes excellent quality
(7) a. three boxes of theirs
b.*three box of theirs
12

c.*three boxes theirs
In short, while a classifier language typically has both Cs and Ms,5 a non-classier
language has neither, though it does have a class of words that share the same semantic
function as Ms in classifier languages.
3. A Math-based Taxonomy of C/M
Any characterization of C and M must reconcile the dilemma that the two converge
structurally in [Num C/M N] and yet diverge semantically. A long-neglected mathematical
perspective offers a unique insight to the relation between Num and C/M as well as the
precise distinction between C and M. The earliest source of such a view we know of is
Greenberg (1990[1972]: 172), where he states with unmistakable clarity that “all the
classifiers are from the referential point of view merely so many ways of saying ‘one’, or
more accurately, ‘times one’.” Thus, san tiao yu [three C fish] of (1a) is seen as [[3 × 1] fish].
Seeing sortal classifiers as a multiplicand with the numerical value of ‘one’ implicates
the entity being quantified must have natural boundaries and thus appear as single units
(Croft 1994: 148, Bisang 1999: 113-121). This view has been pursued in some of the more
recent works, e.g., Bender & Beller (2006), Au Yeung (2005, 2007), and Yi (2009). Her
(2012a) takes this view most seriously in coming up with a precise formulation for the
unification of, and distinction between, C and M.
(8) C/M Distinction in Mathematical Terms (Her 2012a:1679)
[Num X N] = [[Num × X] N], where X = C iff X =1, otherwise X = M.
13

Under this precise formulation, C and M converge in entering the same multiplicative
relation as the multiplicand, with Num as the multiplier. Thus, crucially, while Cs and Ms
converge in denoting one unit, the one unit denoted by Cs has the precise numerical value of
one, but the one unit denoted by Ms does not, e.g., da ‘dozen’ denotes the precise numerical
value of twelve. C/M as a multiplicand denoting one unit thus is naturally identically coded
structurally in a language. This convergence explains why C/M consists of a single syntactic
category and in many respects behaves in a uniform manner. Yet, C and M also diverge in
their respective value: all Cs as the multiplicand must necessarily have the exact numerical
value 1, while an M’s value can be anything except 1 and can thus be numerical or
non-numerical. More simply, an M’s value is never necessarily 1. This divergence in
mathematical value accounts for the semantic differences, and consequent behavioral
differences, observed between Cs and Ms.
The most significant difference is M is semantically substantive but C is semantically
redundant, in the sense that M does, but C does not, contribute additional information to the
head noun (e.g., Greenberg 1990[1974]: 201, W. Li 2000: 1117). Her & Hsieh (2010)
employs Aristotle’s essential vs. accidental property to C/M’s semantic distinction:6 while a
C denotes one or more essential properties of the head noun, an M denotes accidental
properties. This means that a C is semantically redundant in the nominal expression, but an M
is not. For example, the following three expressions, 三隻魚san zhi yu, 三條魚san tiao yu,
and 三尾魚san wei yu, have exactly the same truth condition, i.e., 3 fish, in spite of the
different Cs; yet, if the three different Cs are replaced with three different Ms, then each
expression will have different truth condition, e.g., 三磅魚san bang yu ‘3 pounds of fish’,
三箱魚san xiang yu ‘3 boxes of fish’, and 三籃魚 san lan yu ‘3 baskets of fish’.
This difference between C and M also receives a plausible explanation in the
multiplicative theory: a multiplicand in a multiplicative relation is redundant if and only if its
14

value is 1; a C is thus redundant in a nominal expression, but M is not (Her 2012a). Such
redundancy also manifests itself in Cs’ being transparent to adjectival modification. Thus, (9a)
and (9b) have the same meaning, but (10a) and (10b) do not.
(9) a. 一大顆蘋果 = b. 一顆大蘋果 (Her & Hsieh 2010 (13a))
yi da ke pingguo = yi ke da pingguo
one big C apple one C big apple
‘one big apple’ ‘one big apple’
(10) a. 一大箱蘋果 ≠ b. 一箱大蘋果 (Her & Hsieh 2010 (13a))
yi da xiang pingguo ≠ yi xiang da pingguo
one big M-box apple one M-box big apple
‘one big box of apples’ ‘one box of big apples’
Note that an M can of course be represented redundantly as 1M; however, crucially, the
value of 1M is entirely different from the numerical value of any C, which is exactly 1. For
example, san da [3×dozen] can be expressed redundantly as [3×1dozen]; however, both
expressions are different from [3×1]. Such a misunderstanding is found in N. Zhang (2013:
37), where she claims that Greenberg’s ‘times one’ interpretation of all Cs is true of all
measure words as well:
Greenberg (1972: 10) points out that “all the classifiers are from the referential point of view
merely so many ways of saying ... ‘times one’.” This is also true of all measure words. All
types of CLs and measure words are used in counting, telling us what counts as one in the
context, i.e., the unit of counting (see Croft 1994: 152 and Allan 1977: 293). N. Zhang (2013:
37)
15

Importantly, in Greenberg’s works on numeral classifiers, e.g., Greenberg (1972, 1974,
1975), he has consistently made the distinction between the classifier construction and the
measure construction. It is thus clear that Greenberg only intends for the ‘times one’
interpretation to apply to Cs, not Ms. In fact, in the same passage, Greenberg (1990[1972]:
172) further applies multiplication to two instances of measure words, two dozen and twelve
pairs, and acknowledges that their ‘identity of final numerical result’, which is unmistakably
36, is drastically different from the result of [2×1] or [12×1]. C/Ms are indeed all units of
counting, but the crucial difference between C and M is their inherent mathematical value.
There is thus another caveat to heed: the actual value of an M may accidentally be
precisely 1, but that is not the same as necessarily 1. For example, san bang yu ‘three pounds
of fish’ may just happen to be exactly three fish, each weighing exactly one pound. This sheer
accident does not make pound a C, not even temporally. However precise or imprecise the
value of an M, be it number, weight, volume, size, time, height, length, or monetary value,
the crucial point is that as a multiplicand its mathematical value is not necessarily 1. The
value of a C is necessarily 1, but it can also have an accidental non-numerical value. For
example, san tiao yu ‘3 fish’ may just happen to be exactly three pounds of fish, again each
weighing exactly one pound. This sheer accident likewise does not make tiao an M, not even
temporally.
C thus acknowledges a single unit of an entity with natural boundaries, whereas M creates
boundaries for an entity which may or may not have natural boundaries. Some Ms thus also
encode numerical values, e.g., 2, 12, or a vague number, and create boundaries for entities
with natural boundaries only. Other Ms thus encode non-numerical values and create
boundaries for all entities. Her & Lin (2015) thus put forth the innovative concept that a
16

insightful taxonomy of C/M types can be achieved according to the different types of
mathematical values encoded by C/M, as shown in Table 1.

The two most important criteria for this classification scheme are: first, whether the value
is exactly 1 or not, and second, whether the underlying mathematical value of a C/M as a
multiplicand is numerical or not. The first criterion is crucial because a multiplicand is
redundant only when its value is 1; this unique property sets Cs apart with Ms. The second
criterion is crucial because C/Ms with a numerical value must select nouns that are
delimitable, or atomic, thus countable, while those with a non-numerical value can appear
with either delimitable or undelimitable nouns. Non-numerical measure words thus come in
various subtypes, e.g., volume, container, weight, length, area, time, money, portion, etc.
Any C/M with a fixed or standardized value can be seen as standard, thus including C, M ,
1
and M . It is thus possible for a C/M to be crossed-listed, if its value is ambiguous, e.g., 茶匙
3
chachi ‘teaspoon’ in Chinese can be used as a formal standard measure in cookbooks as well
as a causal container elsewhere without a fixed value. It is thus possible for a container
measure to be M , if its value is numerically fixed, e.g., the container measure 籠 long
1
‘steamer, cage’, when referring to the small steamed pork buns in a Chinese restaurant
17

specialized in the northern cuisine, has a standardized value of 10. However, elsewhere it is
an M or less commonly M , with a numerical or non-numerical but variable value. The
2 4
so-called partitive measure, and also what Zhang (2013) calls ‘individuating’ unit words, are
now part of M and M , depending on whether the value is fixed, e.g., 半 ban ‘half’, or
3 4
variable, e.g., 節 jie ‘section’. A collective measure is now part of M and M , again
1 2
depending on whether its value is fixed, e.g., 打 da ‘dozen’, or variable, e.g., 群 qun
‘group, herd’.
Some linguists also consider event classifiers, e.g., 場 chang, a separate type among
C/Ms. For example, Huang & Ahrens (2003) distinguish three types: individual, event, and
kind. However, an event, by definition, is delimitable and must have a beginning and an end.
Event classifiers are thus merely a subtype of Cs (Lai 2011, Her & Lai 2013). Finally, we
treat the kind unit words, e.g., 種zhong, 類lei, 樣yang, 式 shi, as measure words, more
specifically as a subtype of the non-numerical M . This classification is confirmed by a
4
process of elimination. A kind unit word is not restricted to delimitable nouns, which means it
can only be an M or M . Given that what constitutes as a kind is hardly standardized or fixed,
3 4
it cannot be an M3. The C/M taxonomy thus offers comprehensive coverage of all the
elements that appear as C/M in the constituent formed by Num, C/M, and N.
4. A Formal Semantic Account
In this section, we shall first briefly review several important accounts of formal
semantics, Chierchia (1998a, 1998b), Krikfa (1995), Jiang (2012), X. Li (2011) and Rothstein
(2010), and demonstrate that they cannot model the semantic distinction between C and M
argued for in Section 3, before we propose our own formal semantic account.
4.1 Review of previous accounts
18

The semantics of a C/M is closely related to that of the head noun, as a fundamental
criterion on identifying different types of C/M is the semantics of the nouns they select. Since
Chinese nouns are not marked for plurality, there are two potential theoretical hypotheses for
the semantics of Chinese nouns. The first is that Chinese nouns denote kind, referred to as
‘kind analysis’ in this paper, e.g. Chierchi (1998a), Krifka (1995), etc., and the other is that
Chinese nouns denote mass, i.e. the famous mass noun hypothesis, e.g. Chierchia (1998b),
Hansen (1976), and so on.
We start from the kind analysis. Charlson (1980), observing that bare plurals in English
can denote kind, proposes that kind is a (special type of) individual, which is distinguished
from an individual described a singular count noun, and that kind can be mapped to object
(i.e. individual), which, in turn, can be mapped to stage (Carlson 1980: 69). McNally (2017)
looks into the semantics of kind from another perspective, based on the idea that common
nouns denote distributional representations. However, McNally also proposes a type shifter
KO’ to achieve the same purpose of mapping kind to an object.
There is another type of research on the semantics of nouns that seems relevant here.
Grimm (2012) examines nouns in languages such as Welsh or Maltese, and describes a third
distinction among nouns, in addition to singular/plural and count/mass, i.e., collective/entity.
Nouns in these languages thus have singular and plural morphological markings, demonstrate
the count-mass distinction, and also denote collectivity and entity as well. Morphologically,
collective nouns are not marked, but they are marked when denoting an entity of that
collective (Grimm 2012:53). Grimm (2012: 68) proposes a hierarchy of individualization:
substances < granular aggregates < collectives < individual entities, and suggests that the
grammatical number system for nouns relies on different parts of the hierarchy, e.g.
languages that have a collective/entity distinction use the middle part of the hierarchy.
Chierchia (1998a: 354) explicitly propose that nouns denote kind in Chinese. Chierchia
19

bases his idea on the fact that a bare noun can appear in an argument position in Chinese. A
constituent that can appear in an argument position must be of type e. If Chinese nouns were
of type <e, t>, like English count nouns, then it would be difficult to explain why a
constituent of type <e, t> can appear in a position where a constituent of type e is required.
Although not providing formal details, Chierchia (ibid) identifies as one of the distinctive
features for languages whose nouns are of type e that such languages utilize classifiers.
If Chinese nouns denote kind, then some device is required to map kind to countable
objects, that is, individuals, so that such nouns can be quantitized. Krikfa (1995) proposes
that classifiers performs type-shifting, in a sense similar to Carlson (1980) and McNally
(2017), and maps a kind to countable objects. For example, xiong ‘bear’ is a name referring to
kind, i.e., Ursus, and the other usages, including san zhi xiong [three C bear], are derived
from the kind reading. To account for the [Num C/M N] construction, Krifka proposes an
operator that takes a noun denoting a kind and returns the number of specimens of that kind.
See the example below.
(11) a. zhi = nyix[RT(x, y)  OU(y)(x) = n]
i i
b. san zhi = yix[RT(x, y)  OU(y)(x) = 3]
i i
c. san zhi xiong = ix[RT(x, Ursus)  OU(Ursus)(x) = n]
i i
(Krifka 1995: 401)
In (11), RT applies to a kind and gives us the property of being a specimen or a
subspecies of the kind. OU, object unit, is a function that takes a noun expressing a kind and
gives back the number of the specimens of that kind. The subscripted i represents a possible
world. The number san ‘three’ instantiates the n argument of the classifier zhi, that is, OU
specifies that the number of the specimens of a kind is three. The semantics of xiong is Ursus,
20

a kind, instantiates the y argument in the semantics of san zhi ‘three C’. Therefore, the
semantics of san zhi xiong ‘three CL Ursus’ is: RT maps the kind, Ursus, to specimens, OU
counts the specimens of the kind Ursus, and the number of the specimens is three.
For san qun xiong [three herd Ursus], Krifka analyzes qun as a counterpart of English
herd and its semantics is: nyix[RT(x, y)  herd(x) = n]. For san zhong xiong ‘three kind
i i
Ursus’, the semantics of zhong is nyix[RT(x, y)  KU(y)(x) = n]. As can be seen from
i i
the semantics of zhi and qun, the difference is that qun does not require an OU operator
because its core semantics is herd. On the other hand, the semantic difference between zhi
and zhong is that the former takes an OU operator, which returns the number of specimens of
a kind, while the latter has a KU (kind unit) operator, which gives back the number of kind.
The kind analysis of nouns cannot apply to Chinese nouns for two reasons.7 First, under
Krikfa’s (1995) idea that a classifier serves as a type shifter that maps a kind to an individual,
a noun without a classifier should receive a kind reading. While Chierchia (1998a) does not
discuss the function of classifiers, in this paper Chinese nouns are proposed to express kind.
But, standing alone without a classifier, a Chinese noun does not (necessarily) express kind.
For example, the phrase wu bing er yu (five loaf two fish), gets an individual reading
only, .i.e. five loaves and two fish. In examples without a numeral, such as shu, wo dou
nianwan le ‘book, I all read-finish Pfv’, shu ‘book’ here does not refer to kind as well since it
is impossible to finish reading books as a kind.
Second, it is unclear how exactly type shifter can pick out a coherent individual from a
kind. While it seems natural to think of a kind as consisting of individuals, Carlson’s (1980)
theory treats kind as a type of individual. Then, the question is how the type shifter can
identify a discrete, natural or man-made unit from a kind, e.g., a banana, a car, and a trillion.
This question has not been addressed in works that support the kind-to-individual theory.8 To
resolve this problem, one may think of Grimm’s (2012: 134) definition of ‘wholes’, “any two
21

parts that make up the whole of x [that thing] are connected to each other.” Yet, this definition
is too restrictive for classifiers in Chinese. For example, in this phrase yi ben zhilipuosui de
shu ‘one C in-tatters book’, the classifier and zhilipuosui ‘in tatters’ are still compatible. Such
examples suggest that Grimm’s definition of wholes cannot be applied to Chinese classifiers.
Hence, the second problem remains.
On the other hand, Chierchia (2010) suggests that classifiers, which are of type <k, <e,
t>>, are needed to type shift kind (of type k) to type <e, t> so that numbers, which are of type
<<e, t>, <e, t>>, can go with such a noun. He (1998a 349) further proposes that kind is a
function from worlds w to pluralities. Chierchia (1998b, 2010) suggests that the semantics of
a plural is the set of all the atoms and of all the possible sum individuals of the atoms and that
the semantics of mass equals that of plurals, except for that the boundaries among the atoms
for mass is vague. Chierchia (1998b: 74) further suggests that classifiers map a mass noun to
atoms. Therefore, while technically a classifier can shift the semantic type of a kind (or mass),
it is not clear how the vague boundaries of atoms for a mass noun can be made distinctive so
that individual atoms can be separated from each other. That is, even with Chierchia’s (1998a,
1998b, 2010) ideas, the second problem is still effective.
Next, let’s look at the mass noun hypothesis. Hansen (1976) suggests that Chinese nouns
are mass. Chierchia (1998b) also has a similar proposal.9 As pointed out above, Chierchia
(1998b, 2010) proposes that the semantics of a plural is the set of all the atoms and all the
sum individual of the atoms and that the semantics of a mass noun is like that of a plural,
except for that the boundaries between the atoms for a mass noun is vague. Rothstein (2010),
on the other hand, proposes the following semantics for mass nouns, count singular nouns,
and count plural nouns, based on a complete atomic Boolean algebra M:
22

(12) a. Root nouns: N  M: Root nouns denote a Boolean algebra of mass entities, the
root
closure of a set of atoms in M under the sum operations .
M
b. Mass nouns: N = N
mass root
c. Singular count nouns: COUNT (N ): A singular count noun denotes a set of ordered
k root
pairs of which the first projection is N  k, a subset of N whose members do not
root root
(generally) overlap, and the second projection is the context k.
d. Plural count nouns: in a default context k, PL(N )  M  {k}, where the first
k
projection is the closure of N  k under sum, and the second project is k.
root
COUNT takes the root noun meaning and gives back entities which, in the given
k
context k, are qualified as atoms and thus can be counted. Based on the semantics in (12),
Rothstein also assumes that C/Ms in Chinese are the overt realization of the COUNT
k
operator, which applies to the root meaning (= the mass meaning) of a noun.
X. Li’s (2011) formal semantic analysis of C/Ms is based on Rothstein’s (2010) idea. He
first distinguishes four types: (i) counting classifiers, which identify the natural counting unit
inherent to sets of discrete entities, (ii) classifiers with a measuring reading, which “simply
measure the quantity of entities along a certain dimension, e.g. weight, length,” (X. Li 2011:
126) (iii) classifiers with both counting and measuring readings, and (iv) kind classifiers.
Note that X. Li uses the term ‘classifiers’ for all C/Ms. He also assumes that Chinese nouns
are mass. The semantics of the four types are shown in(13), and the semantics of numbers, in
(14):
(13) a. duo = kx. (x)( kk)Blossom-form( (x)) (x) = k
1 1 2
b. ping = kx. (x)(BOTTLEk)CONTAIN( (x), k) (x)=k
1 1 2
c. jin = nkx.xk  POUND(x) = n
23

d. The kind classifier is an overt lexical realization of the operator , which takes
a kind and gives back the set of subkinds according to a partition.
(14) a. wu = Px.P(x)| (x)| = 5
1 k
b. yi = 1
(13b) is an instance of C/Ms with both counting and measuring readings. Since in
phrases such as yi ping shui ‘one bottle water’ the number expresses the quantity of bottle, the
atom,  (x), is a member of the intersection of bottle and the context variable k. CONTAIN is
1
a relation for containers on the counting reading. (13c) is an example of standard measures
with a measuring reading. The first lambda-bound variable of (13c) is different from that of
(13a) and (13b) because X. Li (2011: 151) claims that a C/M with a measuring reading forms
a constituent with Num first, while those with a count reading, such as (13a) and (13b),
merge with a kind N first. (13d) should be evident by itself.
The semantics of numbers in (14) are proposed in X. Li (2011: 149-151). It is important
to note that numbers have different semantics for different readings: on the one hand, there
are C/Ms with a measure reading only, and on the other hand there are those with a count
reading and those with both count and measure readings. Let’s see the diverse semantic
derivations below.
(15) a. yun = CLOUD
b. duo yun = x. (x)(CLOUDk)Blossom-form( (x)) (x)=k
1 1 2
c. wu duo yun = x. (x)*(CLOUDk)*Blossom-form( (x))| (x)| =5
1 1 1 k
 (x)=k
2
(16) a. shui = WATER
b. wu ping shui = x. (x)(BOTTLEk)  CONTAIN( (x), WATER)
1 1
24

| (x)|=5  (x)=k
1 2
(17) a. yi jin = kx.xkPOUND(x)=1
b. mi = RICE
c. yi jin mi = x.xRICEPOUND(x)=1
As shown in (15)-(17), numbers play different roles and hence have different semantics.
In (15) and (17) wu ‘five’ takes the phrase consisting of a C/M and a kind noun as its
argument, while in (17) yi ‘one’ instantiates the n argument in jin ‘pound’, and the phrase
composed of yi and jin takes a noun as its argument.
Jiang (2012) also adopts the idea that Chinese nouns are kind-referring and a C/M
transform a kind-denoting noun into a set, i.e. <e, t>, so that the atoms in this set can be dealt
with. She claims that this provides a unified account for C/Ms in Chinese because “standard
measures classifiers, like bang ‘pound’, measure parts under sum; kind classifiers, like zhong
‘kind, measure sub-kinds; container classifiers, like wan bowl’, measure parts via a
fill-in-relation with respect to the noun; group classifier like qun ‘group’ measure sets formed
as groups; partitive classifiers, such as ceng ‘layer’ measure partitions.” (Jiang 2012: 139).
Note that Jiang also uses the term ‘classifiers’ for all C/Ms.
While all of the works above are enlightening in deciphering the semantics of C/Ms in
Chinese, they face some challenges. First, they all assume that Chinese nouns are either kind
or mass. As pointed out above, Chinese nouns cannot express kind because, standing alone
without a classifier or as a bare noun, a Chinese noun does not (necessarily) have a kind
interpretation. Moreover, the hypothesis that Chinese nouns are mass has been seriously
challenged as well. For example, Yi (2009, 2011a, 2011b), adopting a similar mathematical
perspective on C/Ms as we do, argues specifically that a lexical distinction of mass/count
25

distinction is needed in Chinese as well as other classifier languages. Kuo and Wu (2010)
propose specific syntactic tests for mass/count distinction in Chinese.10
Particularly, Yi (to appear) argues against what he refers to as a (revised) individualizer
theory, where classifiers are considered as some type of ‘individualizer’, which functions to
‘individualize’ a kind or mass and transforms the kind/mass to atoms, because such an
analysis leads to inconsistencies in both linguistic facts and the syntactic interactions between
numeral, classifiers and head nouns.
Furthermore, Her & Hsieh (2010) and Her (2012) demonstrate that it is not possible for
a C to serve as an ‘individualizer’, and thus that count nouns must be recognized lexically.
Her & Hsieh (2010: 533) use yi gen xiangjiao ‘one C banana’ as an example and argue that:
Under this view [all Chinese nouns are mass], xiangjiao ‘banana’ can only refer to the banana mass, and
the reading of a natural unit of banana with peel is only accidental and due to the classifier gēn, which ‘carves
out’ an elongated discrete unit. This view thus predicts that (5) [yì gēn xiangjiao ‘one C banana’], besides this
natural reading, can also mean an elongated unit of bits or pieces of the banana substance or mashed banana.
Such a reading is simply impossible.
The second challenge is related to the first. Krifka (1995) utilizes an OU to take a kind
as an input and the specimens of the kind as output. Rothestein (2010) uses a  operator for a
similar purpose. Chierchia (2010) suggests that classifiers perform such a function. Yet, it is
not clear how these operators can distinguish nouns that allow this operation from those that
do not. There are nouns in Chinese that behave parallel to mass nouns in English, e.g., shui
‘water’ and mianfen ‘flour’, in that they do not have atoms in their semantics. Obviously, OU
or  cannot apply to such nouns, as no Cs can go with such nouns, which allow Ms only.
26

In X. Li’s (2011) account, numbers come in two different semantics, depending on the
different readings of a [Num C/M N] expression. A unified semantics for numbers is of
course preferred, which is the case under our proposal for the semantics of C/Ms.
In order to capture the semantic distinction between C and M that we have argued for,
we utilize Link’s (2003[1983]) semantics of mass nouns and plural nouns,11 where the
semantics of a singular count noun is a set of entities denoted by the noun. He proposes a *
operator, which takes a set of entities and produces all of the individual sums of the entities.
The sum operation is represented as . If  is an individual and  is another individual, then
 is also an individual (i.e., individual sum), composed of  and , which can be
considered as a plural individual. Here is an example.
(18) a. gou = {Xiaobái, Xiaohuáng, Xiaohēi}
b.
XiǎobáiXiǎohuángXiǎohēi
XiǎobáiXiǎohuáng XiǎobáiXiǎohēi XiǎohuángXiǎohēi
(18a) is a set of three dogs: Xiaobai, Xiaohuang, and Xiaohei. This is the semantics of
singular count noun gou ‘dog’. The * operator applies to gou ‘dog’ and forms the semantics
of plural gou: all of the individual sums of the three dogs, i.e., (18b). Under this definition,
the starred noun now has the same cumulative property as a mass noun. A plural noun and a
mass noun are both closed under sum formation. Any sum of parts of a plural noun is again
the plural noun and any sum of a mass noun is again the mass noun. In (18) for example, if
we perform sum operation on XiaobaiXiaohuang and XiaobaiXiaohei, we get
XiaobaiXiaohuang XiaobaiXiaohei, reducible to XiaobaiXiaohuangXiaohei. If we
execute sum operation on XiaohuangXiaohei and XiaobaiXiaohuangXiaohei, we get
27

XiaohuangXiaohei XiaobaiXiaohuangXiaohei, which, again, can be reduced to
XiaobaiXiaohuangXiaohei. Pick any two individuals in (18b) and perform sum operation,
you get an individual in (18b). This is the cumulative property for plural nouns and mass
nouns. Combining (18a) and (18b), wet get (19):
(19)
XiaobaiXiaohuangXiaohei
XiaobaiXiaohuang XiaobaiXiaohei XiaohuangXiaohei
Xiaobai Xiaohuang Xiaohei
In (19), the bottom level is the atomic level, where the elements in this level are atoms,
i.e. individual dogs. The other levels are non-atomic individual (sum) level, where the
elements in these levels are plural individuals, that is, an individual composed of two or three
dogs.
