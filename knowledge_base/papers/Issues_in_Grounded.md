1. INTRODUCTION Friedrich et al. 2
Journal of Cognition
Much research and theorizing has been directed at explaining the format of mental DOI: 10.5334/joc.444
representations. The classical approach (cf. Ramsey, 2007) states that cognition involves
representations that have the format of amodal symbols, just as words in language are amodal
symbols that represent a referent. Yet, over the past four decades, a large body of empirical
evidence and theoretical arguments from across the cognitive sciences have amassed evidence
to the contrary, that concepts must be grounded in sensory and motor experiences in order
to have meaning (Barsalou, 1999; Fischer & Coello, 2016; Shapiro, 2019). Yet, research has
reached an impasse, and there has been only limited theoretical progress in uncovering further
details regarding the format of mental representations. Here we describe the impasse and how
to surmount it.
In this paper we argue that the field of grounded cognition suffers from two meta-theoretical
issues which obstruct progress. Both result from prematurely attempting to formulate
sophisticated theories without having identified basic principles, which causes both a lack of
conceptual clarity and unsystematic empirical work. In this paper we explicate these two issues,
and consequently formulate our proposed solution, which we call the minimalist account of
grounded cognition. We propose to strip existing theories of their unjustified sophistication,
revert back to basics, and progress incrementally on solid footing. To enable this progress, the
minimalist account identifies common ground across grounded cognition theories and serves
as an overarching theoretical framework. This provides a set of common assumptions and
mechanisms, within which opposing theories can pit their respective hypotheses against one
another. The minimalist account will improve the value of past and future empirical work, allow
for descriptive research, and stimulate a coherent grounded cognition research program.
The meta-theoretical issues described throughout this paper are certainly not unique to
grounded cognition, and are pervasive throughout psychology and cognitive science, as a result
of fundamental differences in subject matter of ‘harder’ (e.g., mathematics, chemistry) versus
‘softer’ sciences (e.g., psychology, sociology; cf. Fanelli & Glänzel, 2013). Lykken (1991) argues
that the harder natural sciences benefit from relative ignorance, which forces them to make
incremental progress. An example is the model of the atom by J.J. Thomson, which won him
a Nobel prize in 1907. This model accounted for the space of known phenomena at the time,
yet with a series of experiments from 1909–1911, Rutherford expanded this space. The next
model, Rutherford’s own, then improved upon Thomson’s by specifying it (Simonyi, 2012). This
example demonstrates the iterative nature of harder sciences: new phenomena reveal issues
in existing theories, which in turn become more specific, until new phenomena put these into
question. Such iteration is unfortunately not the case in the softer sciences, where the space
of phenomena (e.g., intergroup conflicts, emotions) is vast already before the first empirical
investigation (Lykken, 1991).
Instead of small incremental steps during which phenomena are first viewed as simplified
silhouettes, with theoretical progress consisting of ‘zooming in’ to the details, soft sciences
start with the details, being forced to account for the full complex web of causes. Applied to
grounded cognition, this meant attempting to explain the detailed mechanics of the human
conceptual system (cf. Barsalou, 1999; Lakoff & Johnson, 1980), at a time when the state of
knowledge was not able to account for the vast underlying complexity. This explanatory gap
forced grounded cognition theoreticians into taking a theoretical leap, making assumptions
that were perhaps unjustified. This strategy produced overly detailed theories based on
insufficient prior evidence to justify such specificity, and closed the field off to descriptive and
explorative research. Below, we outline the consequences of this over-ambitious leap and then
our proposed treatment.
We preface our main argument with three remarks. First, we want to emphasize at the
outset that the (amicable) criticisms levelled against existing theories will be based on
meta-theoretical arguments, not on empirical evidence. We do not attempt to weigh up
evidence or declare any theory as validated; rather we argue that the theories’ assumptions
were unjustified, which has resulted in a state of research which obstructs theoretical and
empirical development. Similarly, we do not assert to know which theories are sufficiently
validated, but propose that the best way to identify these is by adopting a simplified overarching
theoretical framework as the point of departure for research, the approach we portray here.

Therefore, we only intend to shape, not refute, the rich field of grounded cognition to produce Friedrich et al. 3
Journal of Cognition
a useful tool for future research. It is even possible that central parts of our minimalist account
DOI: 10.5334/joc.444
turn out to be incorrect and should be discarded. Although we believe this is unlikely, even
such a scenario would be a success for the minimalist account because it would constitute
falsification and thereby progress. As we will argue below, falsifying core tenets of current
grounded cognition theories is not facilitated by the currently available theories. Therefore,
this account intends to be useful and representative of the core mechanisms which past
research has elucidated. An empirically motivated assessment of the minimalist account
would be important and we invite this below, but implementing it goes beyond the scope of the
current paper. We therefore do not intend to minimize the great achievements and valuable
contributions of these theories. Indeed, some of their constructs, over 25 years old, are still
pertinent and make up our minimalist account, a testament to their visionary nature. Our
argument aims to be a contribution to the important research field these theories conceived,
and we are fully aware of our debt to their work.
Second, our proposed treatment, the minimalist account, benefits more than just our theories
of mental representations. To understand cognition generally, understanding the substrate of
cognition is critical. This can be gleaned from the various fields in which work has built on the two
central grounded cognition theories discussed here, perceptual symbol systems and conceptual
metaphor theory. Both theories are foundational in research on cognition, including models of
memory, perception, and language. Beyond, their widespread influence is demonstrated by
the fact that they have even been successfully adopted in the fields of consumer psychology
(Landau et al., 2010; Wyer Jr, 2018), psychopathology (Gjelsvik et al., 2018; Törneke, 2020),
robotics (Kim & Maher, 2020; Taniguchi et al., 2016), and more (cf. Glenberg, 2010). Yet, their
benefit to cognitive science does not emerge just from the minimalist account’s contribution
to grounded cognition. Our account also allows to align previously disparate theories, which
generates synergies by using the findings from one field to inform another. Scientific progress
crucially depends on theory integration (cf. Kitcher, 1995), which such an overarching theoretical
framework facilitates and encourages (Muthukrishna & Henrich, 2019). There are, for example,
many theories that rely on simulation with which grounded cognition could be aligned
(Pezzulo, Candidi, et al., 2013), or theories of memory that similarly give action or perception a
constitutional role, such as the Act-In Theory (Versace et al., 2014). Therefore, the account of
mental representations and processes provided here, guided by philosophy of science, arrives
at a solution for meta-theoretical issues which will benefit and integrate disciplines within and
outside grounded cognition.
Third, it is important to mention that we discuss these issues and their solutions in the
context of researchers’ behavior. One of our main points is that descriptive work should be
emphasized over confirmatory research. Yet, descriptive work is often wrongly considered
inferior or less scientific, and therefore less attractive to scientific journals and funding bodies
(Braganza, 2020; Haig, 2013; Rozin, 2001). Therefore, the below-listed issues certainly stem
in part from the incentives set by these stakeholders, and researchers’ dependency on them.
Our proposal should therefore be seen in line with other recent work calling for cognitive
and psychological science to embrace bottom-up, explorative, or descriptive research (e.g.,
Eronen & Bringmann, 2021; cf. also Maner, 2014). We will not focus on the important role of
these and other contextual circumstances, instead focusing on issues and solutions internal
to the field.
We begin with an overview of grounded cognition and its rationale, followed by descriptions
of the two main theories in grounded cognition, perceptual symbol systems and conceptual
metaphor theory. We are necessarily limiting the scope of their description to those parts which
are necessary for appreciating current conceptual problems.1 We then flag the two main issues
we identify in grounded cognition: a lack of conceptual clarity and unsystematic empirical
work. Having elucidated these issues, we propose our solution: the minimalist account of

are left to future research, which should build on the minimalist account in small incremental
steps, as opposed to premature speculative leaps.
2. CLASSIC THEORIES OF GROUNDED COGNITION
Grounded cognition is the research program concerned with understanding how mental
representations of concepts gain meaning by their embedding in the modalities (Barsalou,
2008; Borghi et al., 2017; Glenberg & Gallese, 2012; Kiefer & Pulvermüller, 2012). This field falls
within the broader domain of ‘embodied cognition research’, a term for research characterized
by its focus on the body, environment, and situation as a critical component of cognition
(Fischer & Coello, 2016; Shapiro, 2007).2 It contains various different foci with grounded
cognition’s focus on the mental representation of concepts only being one aspect (Clark,
2008; Newen et al., 2018; Wilson, 2002).3 Importantly, grounded cognition does not assume
that concepts can only be grounded in the body, as may be implied by the term ‘embodied
cognition’ (Barsalou, 2020; Fischer, 2024). Indeed, concept grounding can be accomplished
by factors beyond the body, which makes the term embodied cognition ill-fitting. It has
been proposed that the grounding of concepts is shaped in three ways: Via its situatedness
(situation-specific factors like the orientation of one’s head), embodiedness (body-specific
factors like being right- or left-handed), and tropism (environmental regularities such as the
uni-directional downward pull of gravity; Fischer, 2012; Friedrich et al., 2024; Myachykov et al.,
2014; Pezzulo, Barsalou, et al., 2013).4
Embodied cognition, and grounded cognition especially, existed first as an opponent to
standard cognitive science (Ramsey, 2007). This approach proposed concepts to be amodal
symbols, represented much like words in a ‘language of thought’ (Fodor, 1983; Pylyshyn, 1984;
Quilty-Dunn et al., 2022). Amodal symbols are a format of mental representation in which
the representation is not in a sensory or perceptual format. They are therefore often arbitrary,
sharing no features with their referents. Words, for example, usually share no features with the
referents they represent (e.g., the word lamp does not look like a lamp), and are instances of
arbitrary symbols. This stands in contrast to the modal representations of grounded cognition,
which represent concepts by sensory and motor re-activations resembling those present
when interacting with the conceptual referents. Amodal-symbolic theories of cognition gained
significant popularity in the cognitive revolution. Yet, the strength of this hypothesis was called
into question, in part based on the ‘symbol grounding problem’ (Harnad, 1990; Searle, 1980;
Steels, 2008). The symbol grounding problem points out that amodal symbols could not bear
meaning if they were not attached to physical experiences, and that an amodal approach to
mental representation fails on this account.
Today, the symbol grounding problem is best demonstrated by looking to large-language
models like ChatGPT. There is an intuitively accessible qualitative difference between the
‘cognition’ of large-language models and human cognition. Cognition in large-language
models is the result of training a mathematical model on a corpus of language which allows
2 There is variation in the use of the term ‘embodied cognition’, with some positions being much more
radical in their departure from standard cognitive science, such as radical embodied cognition, enactivism, the
dynamical approach, ecological psychology, and others (Chemero, 2013; Gelder, 1998; Gibson, 1979; Hutto &
Myin, 2012). There is likely little overlap in the contribution of this proposal and these, as they often reject the
notion of mental representations, and instead emphasize interactions between person and environment, such as
affordances. While we certainly endorse the embodied view of cognition, we do not position ourselves in these
more radical camps and are more moderate alongside the authors we cite in the section on grounded cognition.
3 There is inexactness surrounding this terminology. The field we discuss in this paper, which emphasizes the
importance of the modalities in concept representations, has been called “embodied cognition” (e.g., Glenberg
et al., 2008; Lakoff, 2012), “grounded cognition” (e.g., Barsalou, 2008; Pecher, 2018), or “embodied and grounded
cognition” (Borghi et al., 2019; Borghi & Pecher, 2011). Yet the term ‘embodied cognition’ refers to very many
different fields that share few central tenets (Körner et al., 2016; Wilson, 2002). Therefore, we choose the term
grounded cognition to 1) avoid unnecessarily limiting the modalities in which to ground concepts (cf. Friedrich
et al., 2024), and 2) to specify that, within the many versions of embodied cognition, we focus on concept
grounding (in line with Kiefer & Barsalou, 2013).
4 The term “tropism” was introduced by Myachykov et al. (2014) as replacement for the original term,
to prevent confusing the general theoretical approach of grounded cognition with the specific evolutionary
mechanism of “groundedness” proposed by Fischer (2012).

pattern completion. In this sense, a large-language model does not know the meaning of
its answers because each word only refers to other words. It may say that the apple is red,
but only because it knows that apple is often mentioned in the context of red (alongside tree,
sweet, and pie). Yet it cannot be said that the model truly knows what red means because the
‘meaning’ of red only consists of its co-occurrence with these and other words, e.g., sunrise,
wine or communist. Put differently, large-language models’ symbols are not grounded. Their
concepts are encapsulated because their meaning derives solely from their co-occurrence
statistics to other words, and they cannot have experiences (Abbate, 2023; Pezzulo, Parr, et
al., 2024). We humans, on the other hand, have experiences, and our mental representations
are about the external world. This aboutness grounds our cognition, because it grants mental
representations their content (Pezzulo & Castelfranchi, 2007), such that the color of an apple
is the experience of red, and not ‘somewhere between apple, communist, sunrise, and wine’.
This issue of large-language models’ symbols failing to bear meaning directly translates to
amodal theories of concept representation, which similarly suffer from not being connected
to experience. Grounded cognition solves the symbol grounding problem by stating that
symbols are modal, and grounded by virtue of consisting of a re-activation of modal
experiences. This means that the apple is represented by re-activating the sight of redness,
the sweet taste or the sound of a crunch when one bites into it. This is supported by imaging
evidence that both sensory and motor areas in the brain activate during lexical access (e.g.,
Kuhnke et al., 2020). For example, in order to understand the concept kick, similar brain areas
are active as when performing the action itself (Hauk et al., 2004; Pulvermüller & Fadiga,
2010).
Perhaps the most central developments in grounded cognition research have been related
to the kinds of experiences within which concepts can be grounded. In early work, this was
often argued to be the sensorimotor system (Barsalou, 2008). One issue which confronted
such theories, though, was that of abstract concepts. Compared to concrete concepts (e.g.,
cup or mountain), which are experienced by exteroceptive modalities, abstract concepts (e.g.,
justice or democracy) are by definition intangible, and therefore could hardly be represented
by the sensorimotor system (Barsalou, 2003a; Dove, 2009; Mahon & Caramazza, 2008).
Yet, this critique failed to account for the diversity of experiences: Abstract concepts can be
grounded in interoception and meta-cognitive states (e.g., the experience of recognizing
something as true; Barsalou & Wiemer-Hastings, 2005; Connell et al., 2018; Prinz, 2012), as
well as emotions (Kousta et al., 2011; Vigliocco et al., 2009). Later, the role of language as
a means of representing concepts was also emphasized (Dove, 2011; Louwerse, 2011), as
well as contributions from the social world (Borghi & Cimatti, 2009; Reinboth & Farkaš, 2022),
and the role of predictive processing (Borghi et al., 2019; Van Elk & Bekkering, 2018). Today,
a ‘hybrid’ view is most widely accepted, acknowledging that concepts are grounded in the
aforementioned substrates, but also in ‘amodal’ formats (Dove, 2011; Fischer & Shaki, 2018).
Hybrid theories tend to acknowledge that both representational formats exist and, depending
on the cognitive task or situation, are selectively recruited (e.g., Dove, 2014; Paivio, 1990;
Patterson et al., 2007; Zwaan, 2016).
Yet, these grounding substrates do little more than correlate a brain state to a behavior. The
more interesting question is how these experiential aspects of cognition come to represent
concepts. There are many approaches and theories in grounded cognition (see Table 1). Based
on the names used in publications, it is not always clear to which theory an author is referring,
and to what degree they subscribe to details of the theory. We have aligned these as best as
possible in the table below, but do acknowledge that this merely flags up the current lack of
clarity in concept use in grounded cognition. We now discuss the two most central theories
in turn, which we believe cover the vast majority of theoretical positions in the literature on
grounding concepts (including the concepts purported by other theories, cf. action schemas
below), and which are most frequently cited by experiments and reviews (see Table 1). Then we
identify two key epistemological issues within the field. This leads us to the minimalist account
of grounded cognition as an overarching theoretical framework, which provides a common
basis and solution to the issues.

2.1. PERCEPTUAL SYMBOL SYSTEMS
Perceptual symbol systems as a theory states that concepts are represented by multimodal re-
enactments of percepts involved when experiencing those concepts (Barsalou, 2008, 2020).5
It argues that fragments of multimodal perceptions are isolated to become represented as
perceptual symbols (Barsalou, 1999). When later representing the concept, these perceptual
symbols are recombined into so-called simulators that are equivalent with concepts and form
the basis of all cognition. For example, when someone mentions that “there is a cup on the
table”, various contextually-relevant perceptual symbols (the shape of a table or the color of
a cup) are activated in a simulator, which constitutes the mental representation. This holds
even for abstract concepts which differ from concrete concepts by their grounding substrate:
5 Please note that we have diverged from our previous naming convention for this theory, as evident in the
table. In a prior paper we called this theory “simulation theory”, and now “perceptual symbol systems”. We
choose this switch to distinguish better between the mechanism of simulation and the theory perceptual symbol
systems.

Concrete concepts mostly involve simulations of perceptual symbols from the modalities of the Friedrich et al. 7
Journal of Cognition
sensorimotor system, while abstract concepts involve simulations of interoception, or meta-
DOI: 10.5334/joc.444
cognitive states (Barsalou & Wiemer-Hastings, 2005; Kiefer & Barsalou, 2013). For example, in
order to verify the concept of truth, the simulation of that coffee cup on a table can be mapped
to the visual perception of seeing it, and the meta-cognitive appraisal of successfully matching
the two becomes the abstract concept of truth. Perceptual symbol systems emphasizes the
importance of interoception and meta-cognitive states, but this is not to say that other theories
do not also purport grounding via these modalities.
The details of this theory, and how it is applied, differ depending on the authors and the
foci of their respective research. For example, it has been differently named with different
emphases. Situated conceptualization argues that simulators are rich context-dependent
representations, often with a focus on emotion (Lebois et al., 2020; Wilson-Mendenhall et al.,
2011). The perspective effect, where the perspective from which a scenario is described affects
what attributes of an object become particularly salient, also supports this view (Borghi et al.,
2004; Borghi & Barsalou, 2021). Another example includes modality-switch costs, which reflect
concepts described in one modality inhibiting concepts associated with another modality
(Pecher et al., 2003). This view was extended further to become the language as situated
simulation hypothesis (Barsalou et al., 2008). It emphasizes more than its predecessors the
role of language as a shortcut or pointer to concepts. This understanding of cognition as
experiential simulation connects to the larger situated action cycle which describes how such
modal simulations connect to action (Barsalou, 2020, 2021).
There is an important difference between the perceptual symbol systems theory and the
mechanism of simulation, despite them often being equated. The theory brings with it the
constructs and processes posited in seminal theory papers (Barsalou, 1999, 2008), including
simulators which are equivalent to a concept and convergence zones, which enable abstraction
(Simmons & Barsalou, 2003). Yet when other work references this theory, it typically intends to
signify allegiance to the single mechanism, not the theory. The mechanism of simulation only
reflects the covert re-activation of modal perceptions (Pezzulo, Candidi, et al., 2013; Reilly et al.,
2023), without the added theoretical baggage, like simulators or supramodal convergence
zones (although, indeed, abstraction will be an important ability for future research to explain).
This distinction will become important when we propose our minimalist account below.
2.2. CONCEPTUAL METAPHOR THEORY
In contrast to perceptual symbol systems, conceptual metaphor theory states that concepts
are represented by re-using representations from other, more concrete, domains to represent
a target domain (Gibbs, 2005a; Kövecses, 2020a; Lakoff & Johnson, 1999). More specifically,
it argues that throughout human experience primitive schemas (e.g., CONTAINER, which
originates from the many instances of bottles, cups, or boxes holding other objects) repeat
and become cognitively represented in the form of structured patterns (Johnson, 2018). These
patterns, called image schemas, are transformed in a limited number of ways, such as by the
‘multiplex-to-mass’ or ‘following-a-trajectory’ transformations (Gibbs & Colston, 1995). These
transformations turn image schemas into conceptual metaphors (Johnson, 1987; Lakoff, 1987;
Langacker, 1986; Talmy, 1983) which constitute the mental representation of the concept. An
example for this chain of transformations is the image schema of SOURCE-PATH-GOAL which is
applied to the target domain of love, to become the conceptual metaphor LOVE-IS-A-JOURNEY
(which is the origin for sayings like “look how far we’ve come” or “we have reached the end”;
Gibbs, 2005a, p. 92). This then also elicits embodiment signatures in behavior (Gibbs, 2006). For
example, the abstract concept of time is understood by redeploying the more concrete domain
of space, such that forward movement in space leads to a change in the representation of
the abstract concept time, toward the future (Boroditsky, 2000; Loeffler et al., 2017). In short,
conceptual metaphor theory argues that, via image schemas, all conceptual processing
is reasoning that is either image-based (Lakoff, 1990) or “visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and
tactile” (Gibbs & Colston, 1995, p. 394). Primary metaphors are also relevant, although their
relation to the other constructs is not fully clear (Grady, 1997, 2005) and they do not appear
in all texts describing conceptual metaphor theory (e.g., B. Winter & Matlock, 2017). A more
recent development of this theory argues for different levels in the hierarchy of representation,
consisting of the image schema at the most abstract level, followed by the domain, the frame,
and the mental space as the least abstract level (Kövecses, 2017, 2020a).

As in perceptual symbol systems theory, reference to conceptual metaphor theory often does Friedrich et al. 8
Journal of Cognition
not signify allegiance to the full theory, but rather to its core mechanism, which in this case is
DOI: 10.5334/joc.444
metaphoric mapping (see Table 1). The full theory involves image schemas, transformations,
and primary metaphors. The mechanism of metaphor, and the way it is most frequently
referenced, merely describes that an abstract domain is represented by re-deploying
representations from a concrete domain (Casasanto & Gijssels, 2015; Jamrozik et al., 2016).
This view of metaphor relates to the action schema approach (Glenberg et al., 2008), a theory
often posited to be distinct from conceptual metaphor theory (see Table 1). A prototypical
example from this theory is the work of Glenberg and Kaschak (2002) who showed that
linguistic descriptions of object transfer along the midsagittal plane (toward or away) influence
response time when responding with movements along the same axis. Importantly, in relation
to metaphoric mapping, this effect holds also for abstract descriptions like “she told you the
story”. This action sentence compatibility effect (ACE) suggests that meaning comprehension
is related to action planning and that comprehension of even abstract concepts relies on action
schemas. The action schema approach, despite relying on the same mechanism as conceptual
metaphor theory is treated as separate, and this repetition is left unaddressed.
3. ISSUES IN GROUNDED COGNITION
We argue that characteristics of the theories and their consequent application obstruct
progress in understanding the grounding of mental representations. We begin this section by
describing the current state of gridlock in grounded cognition research, its historical background,
and detail the two responsible issues (see also Table 2): a) a lack of conceptual clarity, and b)
unsystematic empirical work.6
The state of theoretical knowledge in grounded cognition research has not significantly
developed in recent years (Zwaan, 2021). The most cited theories are still the aforementioned
two (as also evidenced by Table 1), and when these are cited, the respective original texts are
referenced, which date back 26 and 45 years, respectively (Barsalou, 1999; Lakoff & Johnson,
1980). This suggests that there are few important changes or refutations which would make
the respective references outdated. Newer accounts, such as the Words as Social Tools, the
action schemas approach, or the affective embodiment account (Borghi & Cimatti, 2009;
Glenberg et al., 2008; Kousta et al., 2011), do not refute or build on these prior theories, and are
also by now over 10 years old. In their expansive review, which aimed to collect all accounts
of grounding abstract concepts, Borghi et al. (2017) mention eight, mostly incompatible,
theories of which none were conceived later than 2010. These examples together demonstrate
that theories are put forth but consequent research fails to meaningfully build on them. This
theoretical impasse is further indicated by the fact that descriptions of the grounded cognition
approach in very recent papers do not differ substantially from those published ten or fifteen
years prior; They are consistently limited in their theoretical detail to vague descriptions, with
the core content being that ‘concept representations involve the reactivation of modality-
specific representations from sensorimotor systems’ (e.g., Kemmerer, 2022; Michel, 2023).
There is therefore, despite much time and empirical effort being invested, little additional
understanding in grounded cognition, in the past ten or perhaps even twenty years. What is
the cause of this gridlock?
We argue that the present state of gridlock in progressing the understanding of the format
of mental representations originates from these theories having attempted to advance
prematurely (cf. Bringmann et al., 2022): Wide-sweeping grand claims postulated specific
mechanisms, when the incremental first steps towards establishing such mechanisms had not
been convincingly completed. The first evident consequence of prematurely elaborate theories
is that a theory likely misses the mark when it extrapolates too far beyond the limit of the
current state of knowledge. For example, consider conceptual metaphor theory’s hypothesis
that image schemas undergo one of a limited number of transformations to become
conceptual metaphors, which in turn serve to represent concepts. With little empirical evidence
for the cognitive reality of image schemas, the subsequent steps become increasingly unlikely.
A research program building on this, and similar fastidious hypotheses and overparticular

constructs, will be unlikely to make accurate predictions (Trafimow & Earp, 2016). Therefore, Friedrich et al. 9
Journal of Cognition
our first assessment is that theories which attempt to be too elaborate too early are more likely
DOI: 10.5334/joc.444
to lead down false and unproductive paths of research (Bringmann et al., 2022). An example
of work which did not fall prey to this mistake comes from numerical cognition, where the
initially rather vague postulate of a “quasi-spatial” mental number line (Dehaene et al., 1993,
p. 394) inspired a wealth of specifying research such as identifying its metrical and dimensional
properties (Fischer & Shaki, 2014; B. Winter et al., 2015).
Yet, over-specificity alone would not constitute a severe meta-theoretical issue: An incorrect
theory should, in principle, be falsifiable and thus promptly discarded (cf. Popper, 1959), yet the
current state of grounded cognition is not amenable to such falsification. In an ideal world, with
two opposing theories, the next step would be theory-testing via falsification: identifying critical
hypotheses to find the theory that better7 accounts for experimental findings (Platt, 1964;
Popper, 1959). At first this may seem simple because obvious and important discrepancies
exist between them, like: Do image schemas exist? If so, how many? Do simulators exist?
These specific questions, too numerous to list in full, already point to a problem: the theories
do not share a common ground. Their most fundamental positions (e.g., what is the most
basic building block of cognition, image schemas or fragments of perception?) differ already,
obstructing systematic empirical assessment. In other words, perceptual symbol systems
and conceptual metaphor theory make strong assumptions which prevent comparisons.
Furthermore, with such ostensibly sophisticated theories, empirical research that is focused on
describing or exploring such basic phenomena does not have a theoretical home in which to
embed its findings.
Next, within these overly specific theories, as a result of different authors disagreeing about
different assumptions (e.g., whether image schemas, primary metaphors, or mental space are
the most basic building blocks of cognition), different versions of overly elaborate theories exist,
and this leads to two problematic trends which we will now characterize in more detail. First,
a lack of conceptual clarity comes about, reflected in terminological confusion and inflation.
Such a lack of conceptual clarity subsequently results in unsystematic empirical work that
engages in neither falsification nor descriptive research. This is either due to being forced to
remain theory-neutral in order to avoid buying into unnecessary theoretical baggage, or due
to designing and operationalizing experiments which must make strong implicit assumptions
(e.g., a limited number of image schema transformations; see Table 2).
3.1. LACK OF CONCEPTUAL CLARITY
Much progress in science revolves around commensurability of theories: when two theories
address the same phenomenon, they can be integrated to inform each other and gradually
expand to explain novel observations (Kuhn, 1962; Oberheim & Hoyningen-Huene, 2009).
Incommensurability, on the other hand, describes a state in which theories cannot be combined,
threatening progress. Incommensurability is often the result of a lack of conceptual clarity
(Hagger, 2014) because theories that use different terms to address the same phenomena
cannot be integrated. This often results from conceptual clutter (Jones et al., 2016; Morrison &
Grammer, 2016) and related, the jingle-jangle fallacy (Block, 1995; Kelley, 1927), where similar
terms for different constructs (jingle) and different terms for the same construct (jangle) co-
exist (Dang et al., 2020; Wulff & Mata, 2023). Conceptual clutter prevents the cumulative
progress of science because theories cannot converge in order to build on one another (Gerring,
1999; Locke, 2003).
Conceptual clutter is found throughout grounded cognition theories, highlighting the need
for commensurate constructs. For example, conceptual metaphor theory proposes the
existence of image schemas (also called “cognitive primitives” in Lakoff, 2012, or “schema
structure” in Lakoff, 2014) and primary metaphors. In a coherent theoretical framework,
these two components should be co-occurrent, yet many important works exist where only
image schemas, and not primary metaphors, are mentioned (e.g., Gibbs, 2005b; Richardson
et al., 2003). Alternatively, sometimes only primary metaphors are discussed (Lakoff, 2014;
7 This is a much-simplified sketch of the process, we acknowledge that there are details and caveats to this
approach. In this sense, the word ‘better’ refers to a full and complex evaluation of a given theory. Therefore,
abiding Occam’s Razor, a simpler explanation would be preferred to a complicated one (cf. Lakatos, 1976). We
acknowledge these and other caveats, but they are not further relevant for the current paper.

Journal of Cognition
the same as cognitive primitives, another name for image schemas; Lakoff, 2012), or image
DOI: 10.5334/joc.444
schemas and primary metaphors as taking place on the same level (e.g., Kövecses, 2020b).
Furthermore, beyond image schemas and primary metaphors, a wealth of other categories
exists. Some authors distinguish structural, orientational, and ontological metaphors (e.g.,
Łącka-Badura, 2016; Lakoff & Johnson, 1980), or spatial relation- and force-type ‘cogs’ (another
term for cognitive primitives, i.e., image schemas; Lakoff, 2012; also attributional vs. relational
metaphors; Gentner et al., 2001; or resemblance vs. correlation-based metaphors; Grady,
2008). Even when these terms are mentioned alongside one another, their functions within
theories are not consistent: Some authors state that image schemas are the basic building
blocks (Kövecses, 2008), others focus on primary metaphors (Grady, 1997; Lakoff, 2014).
Without this consistency in their function, these terms become useless as a reference. A similar
problem arises from the absence of an accepted or widely used definition of image schemas
(Pecher et al., 2011). They are at times described as kinetic analog representations of spatial
relations (Gibbs & Colston, 1995), experiential (Gibbs, 2005b) or schematic (Kimmel, 2009)
gestalts, preconceptual structures, etc. (cf. Hampe, 2005; Mandler & Pagán Cánovas, 2014). It
is also unclear how many there are, ranging from around two dozen (Johnson, 1987; Lakoff,
1987) to hundreds (Cienki, 1997; Johnson, 2018).
Across grounded cognition we find jingle and jangle in constructs, constituting many slightly-
different versions of the same theory, thereby preventing continuity between and within
theories. The various names given to grounded cognition theories are examples of jangle (for
an overview see Table 1), being very similar but different-sounding. In conceptual metaphor
theory some theoretical enclaves (new versions of theories which differ slightly from the
original but nonetheless rely on many of the same central posits) are Lakoff’s (1987) work,
Boroditsky’s metaphoric structuring account (Boroditsky, 2000), the neural theory of language
(Gallese & Lakoff, 2005), a novel extended conceptual metaphor theory (Kövecses, 2020a), or
just metaphor theory (Merritt et al., 2010). Similar jangle exists in perceptual symbol systems
theory which has been called: perceptual symbol systems (Barsalou, 1999) or perceptual
symbol systems theory (Horchak et al., 2014), situated conceptualization (Barsalou, 2009),
situated simulation (Barsalou, 2003b), language as situated simulation (Barsalou et al., 2008),
or often just simulation (Glenberg et al., 2008). These are, of course, not to be confused with
the ‘embodied simulation theory’ (Gallese, 2005; Gallese & Sinigaglia, 2011) or the many other
different names for ‘simulation’ theories (Pezzulo, Candidi, et al., 2013), which presents an
instance of jingle.
These examples of conceptual clutter and jingle-jangle are symptoms of premature
advancement, and generate obstacles to meaningful theoretical progress. Firstly, theories
that attempt to be elaborate and detailed, without adequately understanding their most
fundamental components, result in many enclaves and disputes about details of constructs
that are in themselves speculative. Second, prematurely specific theorizing closes the field
off to valuable descriptive and exploratory (as opposed to ever more theory-laden) research,
which only exacerbates the development of theoretical enclaves. This triggers a cycle in which
development is impeded because the theories are not constrained by basic phenomena, which
cannot be discovered as a result of little descriptive research, which is in turn the result of
conceptual clutter, which prevents discovering basic phenomena to constrain theories, and
so on. Together, these trends all prevent pruning of unsupported constructs. The resulting
impediment of theoretical progress is evident. If even within conceptual metaphor theory there
are many different versions of a theory, which each only permits tests within itself, how should
this form a coherent whole to contest against perceptual symbol systems theory?
Philosophers of science have proposed different solutions for a lack of conceptual clarity (cf.
Podsakoff et al., 2016; Wulff & Mata, 2023), but we argue that grounded cognition is just not
yet ready for grand theories which can justifiably posit such specific constructs. Instead, the
field should ‘go back to basics’ (Bringmann et al., 2022). We argue that going back to basics
consists of reverting to a silhouetted and non-detailed point of departure, and progressing with
bottom-up, inductive research (cf. Aguinis & Vandenberg, 2014). This approach ensures that
there are relatively few assumptions.
We choose to focus on two basic mechanisms in the following minimalist account, without
assuming any further details. This simplification is in contrast to conceptual metaphor theory’s

postulating a limited number of image schema transformations, which already takes for granted Friedrich et al. 11
Journal of Cognition
the existence of image schemas. Its further claim about a limited number of transformations in
DOI: 10.5334/joc.444
turn assumes that something innately limits the amount of transformations, and so on. Without
making such unfounded assumptions, the minimalist account should be attractive, no matter
which theory’s prior assumptions one disagrees with. Moreover, when using the minimalist
account, any departure from, or extension to, the theory should be well-evidenced, which
should in turn limit the creation of theoretical enclaves. A common overarching theoretical
framework such as this prevents conceptual clutter by generating commensurability between
camps of grounded cognition, and across cognitive science, therefore encouraging a coherent
research program.
3.2. UNSYSTEMATIC EMPIRICAL WORK
How does empirical work position itself when multiple incommensurable enclaves of theories
exist? Some authors have argued it generates “a potpourri of disconnected empirical findings”
(Muthukrishna & Henrich, 2019, p. 2), or in other words, unsystematic empirical work. Empirical
work in grounded cognition is characterized by two strategies: authors either do not align with
one specific theory, preferring to avoid the murky waters of conceptual clutter and theoretical
baggage; or they already agree on the theory’s basic assumptions (e.g., the existence of
simulators). Both strategies fail to serve the goal of falsification. Perhaps most intuitively, this
problem is reflected in the fact that empirical work prefers to reduce overly elaborate theories
to their basic mechanisms during operationalization, suggesting that experimenters intuit that
this is the boundary of what is currently known.
The lack of rigorous theory-testing is harmful, and yet pervasive in the field, as demonstrated
by both experimentally-driven and theoretical work. First, experimental work that is clearly
located within grounded cognition, and that also draws on related theoretical and empirical
work (as indicated by citations), often does not refer explicitly to either “embodied cognition” or
“grounded cognition” at all, let alone to specific theories (e.g., Dils & Boroditsky, 2010; Kaschak
et al., 2005). On the other hand, the authors could declare allegiance to a specific theory (e.g.,
Richardson et al., 2001), but this incurs a full allegiance to all detailed postulates, which is
rare. Additionally, because of the strong assumptions which accompany these theories,
the outcomes cannot subsequently be compared against another theory. For this reason,
common practice is less stringent: In most cases where allegiance is proclaimed, it smudges
over the theories within the field. There is reference to so-called “embodied effects” that are
theoretically backed by citing vague entities like “theories of embodied cognition” (Jostmann
et al., 2009, p. 1169) or the “embodied cognition approach” (Fischer & Brugger, 2011, p. 5;
Tolentino-Castro & Raab, 2021, p. 1; Werner et al., 2019, p. 171), which are similarly-vaguely
