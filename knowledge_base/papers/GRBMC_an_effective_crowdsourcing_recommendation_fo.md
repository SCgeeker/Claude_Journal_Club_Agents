multi-dimensional characteristics of the workers and the community characteristics of the crowd. This paper
proposes a worker group recommendation method based on multi-community collaboration (GRMBC) by uti-
lizing the worker characteristics information extracted from crowdsourcing platform. Based on the character-
istics of workers’reputation, preference and activity, the method divides the worker group into several
characteristics communities with similar behavior to discover the potential multi-community structure in the
crowdsourcing worker group, and then selects Top-N worker group for recommendation through the interaction
among multi-communities. At the same time, we also proposed two mitigation strategies for the cold start
problem of data in crowdsourcing. This paper uses the public data collected by AMT to do the experiments, and
compares the aggregation results of the recommendations generated by different algorithms. The results show
the recommendations generated by the GRBMC algorithm proposed in this paper performs the best compre-
hensively. When the GRBMC algorithm that considers both worker attributes and communi-ty characteristics has
an accuracy improvement of 0.03 ~ 0.04 compared with not using the recommendation algorithm on each index,
the accuracy of 0.01 ~ 0.02 is improved com-pared with the method considering single characteristic. Moreover,
compared with the individual recommendation method of the workers, the recommendation method of the
workers’ group is more in line with the platform requirements, and can well reflect the wisdom of crowd wisdom.

infer the potential characteristics of the new task.

Fig. 5. The answer aggregation results at different thresholds δ and the impact of different N on recommended performance.
As shown in Fig. 3, by analyzing the characteristics of the workers
who apply for the new task, and by doing weighted calculation with the
worker’s confidence weight, the initial characteristics model of the new
task (p1 ,p2 ,...,pC ) is obtained. Then, the similarity between the char-
acteristics model and each of the preference characteristics (π 1,1 ,π 2,2 ,...
,π C,C ) is calculated. Finally, according to the similarity, the potential
characteristics distribution model corresponding to the new task is ob-
tained, and it is used as one of the basis for the group recommendation of
workers.
5.2. The cold start problem of new workers
On crowdsourcing platforms, when a new worker engages in a task,
there is no assessment information of the worker on the platform, or he
has insufficient historical information, both of which will lead to the
cold start problem. Thus it is difficult for the platform to recommend
tasks specifically for a worker. In order to solve this problem, this paper
proposes a method of similarity measurement of workers’ characteristics Fig. 6. Worker ability matrix.
