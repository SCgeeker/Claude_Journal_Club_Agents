1. Non-Native Language Comprehenders Mentally Simulate the Implied Shape of Objects
More than half of the people in the world use more than one language (Grosjean, 1982), yet
compared with native language1 processing, little is known about the relation between conceptual
memory and language comprehension in a non-native language. The use of native and non-native
languages differs in several ways that relate to the form of language including pronunciation,
grammatical competence, speech rate, vocabulary size, and others. These differences raise the
question of whether the nature of meaning processing might differ as well. In particular, we ask
f
whether non-native language comprehension activates conceptual moemory in the same way as
o
native language comprehension and whether non-native language comprehension leads to similar
r
p
memory traces of the content of language as native language comprehension.

1.1 Mental Simulation and Language Comprehension
r
According to a strong version of the Pgrounded cognition view, conceptual memory relies on
sensorimotor processes to ground concelptual representations (Barsalou, 1999; Glenberg, 1997;
a
Pulvermüller, 1999). This embodnied approach to concept representation proposes that mental
r
representations reflect the details and dynamics of actual experiences, which has been corroborated
u
o
by both behavioural (e.g., Borghi et al., 2004; Mannaert et al, 2017; Pecher et al., 2003, 2004, 2009;
J
Solomon & Barsalou, 2004; Stanfield & Zwaan, 2001; Zwaan & Pecher, 2012; Zwaan et al., 2002), and
neural findings (e.g., Pulvermüller, 1999). A widely adopted explanation of how cognition might be
grounded in sensorimotor processes is the perceptual symbols theory, in which Barsalou (1999)
suggests that, instead of amodal propositional processing, conceptual knowledge is represented
through mental simulations of sensorimotor experiences. The perceptual symbols that make up
these sensorimotor simulations are believed to be modal and analogical, as they are assumed to be
represented in the same neural systems that process perceptual and motor information of physical
exemplars. Barsalou describes these perceptual symbols as records of neural activation patterns that
1 We use native language to refer to a person’s first language and non-native language for any other language
that a person speaks. We prefer to use non-native over L2 because the language that is tested in a study is not
always the second (rather than third, fourth, etc.) language that a person learned or speaks.

4
emerge during perception, rather than physical pictures or mental images. He assumes them to be
dynamic, meaning that different contexts may activate varying neural activation patterns. For
example, the simulation of a watermelon will be different when reading about someone buying one
(e.g., a green sphere) as opposed to reading about someone eating one (e.g., a red slice) (Wu &
Barsalou, 2009).
Several paradigms have been developed to further explore the mechanisms of grounded
cognition. Perhaps one of the most productive and influential ones relating language comprehension
f
to mental simulation of concepts was developed by Zwaan et al. (200o2). The sentence-picture
o
verification task provides evidence that readers construct visual simulations of objects that vary as a
r
p
function of linguistic context. Participants read sentences that imply a particular shape for an object.
-
e
For example, the sentence There was an owl in the sky implies that the owl is flying, whereas the
r
sentence There was an owl in the barn impliePs that the owl is perched. After reading the sentence,
participants are shown a picture and havle to decide whether the object in the picture was
a
mentioned in the sentence. On tnrials of interest, the picture shows the object mentioned in the
r
sentence (e.g., an owl) that either matches (e.g., outstretched wings for the first sentence) or
u
o
mismatches (e.g., folded wings for the first sentence) the implied shape. In the original work and in
J
several replications (De Koning et al., 2017; Pecher et al., 2009; Sato et al., 2017; Zwaan & Pecher,
2012; Zwaan et al., 2018), participants respond faster and more accurately when the shape of the
object in the picture matches the shape that was implied by the sentence than when they mismatch.
These findings are obtained even though the shape of the object is not explicitly described in the
sentence; moreover, the task does not require participants to pay attention to the specific shape of
the object depicted in the picture. While the necessity of simulations for language comprehension
has been debated (Mahon & Caramazza, 2008), the observed match effect suggests that sentence
comprehension does trigger the generation of visual simulations corresponding to the sentence
content.. In other words, language and memory interact to form a mental simulation; the content of

5
the mental simulation is determined both by the sentence content and by the information retrieved
from conceptual memory.
Studies using the sentence-picture verification task, and variations thereof, have reported
similar findings for other perceptual properties such as orientation (Pecher et al., 2009; Stanfield &
Zwaan, 2001; Zwaan & Pecher, 2012), color (Mannaert et al., 2017; Zwaan & Pecher, 2012, but see
Connell, 2007), size (de Koning et al., 2017) and motor actions (Bergen et al., 2003). However, this
paradigm suffers from the potential criticism that even though successfully responding to stimuli
f
does not require construction of shape-specific visual simulations, theo task might promote this
o
process simply because sentences are immediately followed by images. The delayed picture
r
p
recognition task is a related paradigm that addresses this concern (Pecher et al., 2009). During the
-
e
initial study phase of this paradigm, participants read sentences and are asked to indicate whether
r
they make sense or not (i.e., filler sentences Pare nonsensical). In the subsequent surprise test phase,
participants see pictures of objects and inldicate whether the object in the picture was mentioned in
a
one of the sentences presented dnuring the earlier phase of the study. Because the surprise memory
r
test is given only after all sentences have been read, participants do not know while reading
u
o
sentences that images will be presented later on, hence any visual details that they generate during
J
comprehension cannot be the product of this aspect of the design. Studies using this paradigm
reveal better recognition memory when the perceptual characteristics of the object in the picture
match those implied by the sentence than when they mismatch, providing evidence for spontaneous
mental simulation during language comprehension (Pecher et al., 2007, 2009).
1.2 The Role of Mental Simulation in Non-Native Language Comprehension
In the studies described above, language comprehenders read sentences in their native (i.e.,
first) language. In the work described here, we will address whether non-native language users
display the same behavioral indices of sensorimotor processes in conceptual memory during
language comprehension as native speakers do and, if so, whether this occurs spontaneously during
naturalistic language processing or only in tasks that bring attention to these features. Researchers

6
have argued that the processes involved in native and non-native language comprehension may be
different because the languages are learned in different ways (Chen et al., 2020; Günther et al.,
2018; Norman & Peleg, 2022). The reasoning is that the native language is learned in direct
interaction with other people and the physical world. This is assumed to promote the formation of
links between sensorimotor representations and the native language. Non-native languages learned
later in life are often acquired in a formal setting such as school rather than in direct interaction with
the world. Hence, people may have weaker links between sensorimotor representations and the
f
non-native language (Chen et al., 2020; Foroni, 2015; Kogan et al., 20o20; Norman & Peleg, 2022). As
o
a result, mental simulations may play no role in non-native language comprehension. Thus far, the
r
p
handful of studies addressing this issue have reported mixed results.
-
e
Participants in a study by Ahn and Jiang (2018) performed a sentence-picture verification
r
task in their non-native, second language (L2P), in this case, Korean. The results showed a shape
match effect for non-native speakers, whlich indicates that non-native comprehenders simulate
a
sentence meaning. However, then stimuli in this study were not fully counterbalanced, as only one
r
picture was paired with each object. Consequently, sentences were confounded with condition,
u
o
complicating the interpretation of results. Furthermore, using a fully counterbalanced design,
J
Norman and Peleg (2022) found a shape match effect in the immediate sentence-picture verification
task when participants read sentences in their native language (Hebrew) but not in when they read
sentences in their non-native language (English). Chen et al. (2020) tested the delayed shape match
effect in L1 (Cantonese), L2 (Mandarin), and L3 (English), but found no overall effect of picture match
in the hit rates nor an interaction with language. When they analyzed the reaction times, however,
they observed a match effect in L1 but not in L2 and L3. This finding, together with that of Norman
and Peleg, suggests that perceptual simulation is restricted to one’s native language. Nonetheless,
the lack of an effect in the hit rates even for native speakers is puzzling, since Pecher et al. (2009) did
find better recognition memory for matching than for nonmatching pictures. Additionally, the
analysis of reaction times poses a particular challenge because they can only be analyzed for hits,

7
causing the exclusion rate to be quite high (over 25% of the trials in their study). Thus, these results
suggest that non-native speakers do not activate visual simulations during sentence comprehension,
albeit with some caveats, and stand in contrast to results from studies using different paradigms that
have found evidence for sensory-motor simulations in non-native speakers (Ahlberg et al., 2018;
Bergen et al., 2010; Dudschig et al., 2014; Wheeler & Stojanovic, 2006; see Kogan et al., 2020;
Monaco et al., 2019 for reviews).
1.3 Overview of the Present Study
f
The present study examined the match effect using two paraodigms, one of them being the
o
standard sentence-picture verification task (Zwaan et al., 2002). Because this match effect has
r
p
already been well established in native speakers we presented the task to non-native speakers only.
-
e
If non-native language comprehension processing routinely involves mental simulation, participants
r
should show faster and more accurate respoPnses when the shape of the depicted object matches
the shape that was implied in the precedling sentence than when it mismatches the shape that was
a
implied in the sentence—just as nit does for native comprehension. We tested the match effect in a
r
sample of university students who are exposed to English (their non-native language) almost every
u
o
day. They follow lectures in English, most of their study materials are in English, and students in the
J
international track have discussion meetings in English. Outside their educational activities they
speak English informally with fellow students. Given that the speed of semantic activation in non-
native language processing may depend on language use (De Bruin et al., 2016) we thus optimized
the chances of obtaining match effects in the sentence-picture verification task.
Second, we used the delayed picture recognition task (Pecher et al., 2009) to rule out the
alternative explanation that a possible match effect in the standard sentence-picture verification
task depends on strategically employed mental imagery. For the standard sentence-picture
verification task it is possible that participants use mental imagery as a memory aid, given that the
pictures are presented directly after each sentence. In this case, those results would not be
representative of naturalistic non-native language comprehension and thus, in the delayed

8
recognition task, performance in the match and mismatch conditions would not differ. If, however,
visual simulations are generated spontaneously during language comprehension and encoded in
memory, picture recognition memory performance should be better for the match than for the
mismatch condition.
Finally, we ask whether the degree of competence in a non-native language predicts the
degree of native-like sensorimotor activation of conceptual representations during comprehension.
We conduct correlational analyses to investigate whether the degree of mental simulation was
f
related to the level of English language proficiency, as measured by thoe LexTALE task, a validated and
o
performance-based test of proficiency (Lemhöfer & Broersma, 2011). De Grauwe (2014) and Vukovic
r
p
(2013) have previously suggested an association between second-language proficiency and motor
-
e
simulation, an idea that has received some empirical support (Ahlberg et al., 2021; Foroni, 2015;
r
Wheeler & Stojanovic, 2006). The relationshiPp between second-language proficiency and visual
simulation, on the other hand, has not relceived empirical support. Norman and Peleg (2022)
a
measured language proficiency inn the non-native language using the LexTALE task, as well as other
r
language proficiency measures, and did not find that language proficiency predicted performance in
u
o
the sentence-picture verification task. However, because they did not find a match effect for the
J
non-native language it is difficult to draw strong conclusions regarding the role of language
proficiency in visual simulation in non-native language comprehension. Given that multiple studies
have reported evidence for a relationship between second-language proficiency and motor
simulation, we tested this relationship for visual simulation as well. Specifically, we asked whether
participants who are less proficient in the English language generate visual simulations to a lesser
extent than highly proficient participants.

2.1 Method
We report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions (if any), all
inclusion/exclusion criteria, whether inclusion/exclusion criteria were established prior to
data analysis, all manipulations, and all measures in the study. No part of the study
procedures or analysis plans was preregistered prior to the research being conducted.
2.1.1 Participants
A total of 109 non-native speakers of English were recruited for the study. All participants
were students at the Erasmus University Rotterdam who participated in exchange for course credits.
f
o
The data of 88 participants were included in the final statistical analyses (information about
o
exclusion criteria is provided further down). The participants rermaining in the analyses consisted of
p
73 females (83%), 14 males (16%), and 1 participant who did not identify with either gender (1%).
-
e
Their ages ranged from 18 to 31 years old (M = 20.4, SD = 2.1).

P
Students in the Psychology program are proficient in English language comprehension.
l
Erasmus University offers two tracks ain the 3-year bachelor Psychology program: a Dutch language
n
track and an international (English language) track. In both language tracks, lectures are provided in
r
u
English and students read English textbooks and journal articles. The major difference is that the
o
small group meetings students attend two or three times a week contain literature discussions and
J
exercises in either Dutch or English, depending on the track the student has chosen. Most Dutch
students have 6 years of secondary education throughout which they have taken English classes and,
in more informal settings, have been exposed to English via movies and television programs on
regular broadcast (with Dutch subtitles) since childhood. Additionally, English is frequently spoken
when travelling abroad. The educational and cultural background of the international students is
more diverse, however they have all self-selected to take part in the English language program at
Erasmus University and needed to show proof of English proficiency prior to admission. This could
constitute either a secondary education diploma of which English was part of the final exam, proof
of having attended secondary school in an English-speaking country (e.g., UK or New Zealand), or
having obtained a TOEFL score ≥ 6.5 or IELTS score ≥ 90.

10
The sample included native speakers of 18 different languages: Dutch (n = 47), German (n =
9), Romanian (n = 4), Turkish (n = 4), Spanish (n = 3), Vietnamese (n = 3), Russian (n = 2), Papiamento
(n = 2), Bulgarian (n = 2), Italian (n = 2), Arabic (n = 1), Croatian (n = 1), Estonian (n = 1), Finnish (n =
1), Greek (n = 1), Nepali (n = 1), Norwegian (n = 1), Portuguese (n = 1), and multilingual (n = 2; 1
German/Romanian and 1 Russian/Latvian).
2.1.2 Stimulus Materials
For the sentence-picture verification task, a set of 60 sentence-picture quadruplets was
f
generated comparable to the materials used by Zwaan et al. (2018) coonsisting of 31 artefacts, 9
o
animals, and 20 other natural objects. One quadruplet contained two sentences and two grayscale
r
p
photographs showing the object on a white background (see Table 1 for an example). Each object
-
e
picture matched the shape of the object that was implied by one of the sentences, enabling the
r
creation of two matching and two mismatchPing sentence-picture combinations. Each participant was
presented only one sentence and one piclture from each quadruplet. Four counterbalanced versions
a
of the experiment were generatend to enable the use of all sentence-picture combinations. All
r
counterbalanced versions contained 30 matching and 30 mismatching sentence-picture pairs. Across
u
o
the four versions, all items were used equally often in the match and mismatch condition.

Note. The sentence and picture presented on the same line of the table form matching
combinations. Mismatching combinations are formed by switching the sentences.
A set of 60 additional sentence-picture pairs were used as fillers. The filler sentences were
similar to the experimental sentences in length and position of object nouns, but were followed by
an unrelated picture (i.e., one not mentioned in the preceding sentence), thus requiring a “no”
response. For half of the filler sentences there was a comprehension question, 15 requiring a “yes”
response and 15 a “no” response (see Table 2 for an example). These comprehension questions
f
were included to ensure that participants processed the meaning of tohe sentences. An additional set
o
of 10 sentence-picture pairs, 6 including a comprehension question, were used for practice. Filler
r
p
and practice stimuli were identical for all participants.
-
e
Stimuli used for the LexTALE task were obtained from Lemhöfer and Broersma (2011) and
r
consisted of 40 words (e.g., scornful), 20 nonPwords (e.g., mensible), and 3 practice items (2 words
and 1 nonword). All words and sentencesl were spelled in British English. The tasks were
a
administered online using Inquisnit Web (Millisecond).

2.1.3 Procedure

Participants first completed the LexTALE task (Lemhöfer & Broersma, 2011) to assess their
language proficiency. The instructions and procedure for the LexTALE task were similar to the online
version on www.lextale.com. On each trial an item was presented in the center of the computer
screen with two response buttons below the item. The “no” button was red and presented on the
left, the “yes” button was green and presented on the right. Participants used the mouse to click on
the “yes” button for words and on the “no” button for nonwords. After their response the screen
was blank for 500 ms, followed by the next item. The order of items was fixed in the order used by
f
Lemhöfer and Boersma (2011). o

After completing the LexTALE task, participants received instructions stating they would be
presented sentences and pictures, after which they had to decide whether the depicted object had
been mentioned by the sentence. Participants were informed that some trials included a
comprehension question following their response to the picture. Each trial started with a fixation (+),
vertically centered and left-justified, for 500 ms, immediately followed by the sentence. The

13
sentence was also left-justified so that the first letter appeared at the same location as the fixation.
The sentence remained on the screen until participants pressed the space bar to indicate they had
read and understood the sentence. Then a fixation (+) was presented in the center of the screen for
500 ms, immediately followed by the picture. The picture remained on the screen until the
participant responded by pressing the K-key if the depicted object was mentioned in the sentence,
or the S-key if the depicted object was not mentioned in the sentence. An incorrect response was
followed by feedback (“Incorrect”) for 500 ms. Half of the filler trials were followed by a yes/no
f
comprehension question. Participants also used the K and S keys to aonswer the comprehension
o
question. Each trial was followed by an interval of 1000 ms before the next trial started. Participants
r
p
were instructed to respond as quickly and accurately as possible. The experiment started with 10
-
e
practice trials, followed by 120 experimental trials. The trial procedure was identical for practice and
r
experimental items. Practice items and expePrimental items were presented in a new random order
for each participant. l

After completing the senntence-picture verification task, participants were asked to provide
r
their gender, age, and native language. The tasks were administered online using Inquisit Web
u
o

2.1.4 Data Analysis
The dependent measures for the sentence-picture verification task were the mean response
times (RT) and proportion of errors. In total, data from 21 participants were removed from the
analysis, following exclusion criteria used in prior studies with the sentence-picture verification task
(Mannaert et al., 2017; Zwaan & Pecher, 2012), because a) the participant responded incorrectly on
more than 20% of the pictures (n = 4), b) their mean reaction time was more than 3 SD above the
group mean (n = 1), c) they had already participated earlier (n = 2), or d) they reported to be a native
speaker of English (n = 8). To ensure equal numbers of participants in each of the four
counterbalanced versions, we excluded the last tested participants (n = 6) in versions that had more
participants than the version with the fewest so that 22 participants remained in each version. For

14
all participants remaining in the analyses, reaction times that deviated more than 3 SD from the
participant’s mean were treated as outliers. All data from both experiments that were used for the
analyses are available from https://osf.io/dsgc9/
LexTALE scores were obtained by computing d’ values, where hit rates are the proportions of
correct (‘yes’) responses to words and false alarm rates are the proportions of incorrect (‘yes’)
responses to nonwords. Based on these hit and false alarm rates we calculated d’ using the
Snodgrass-Corwin correction (Snodgrass & Corwin, 1988).
f
2.2 Results and Discussion o
o
Mean RT and accuracy for the sentence-picture verification task were calculated for each
r
p
participant and condition. Reaction times that deviated more than 3 SD from the participant’s mean
-
e
were removed as outliers (2.08 % of the correct reaction times). The mean error rates and trimmed
r
reaction times are presented in Table 3. PartPicipants responded faster to match than to mismatch
pictures, t(87) = 2.08, p = .040, Cohen’s dlz = 0.22, and made fewer errors to match than to mismatch
a
pictures, t(87) = 2.12, p = .037, Cnohen’s d = 0.23. Thus, we replicated the match effect.
z
r
Because studies using the sentence-picture verification task often base statistical analyses
u
o
on the median RTs for each participant and condition (e.g., Mannaert et al., 2017; Stanfield & Zwaan,
J
2001; Zwaan et al. 2002; Zwaan & Pecher, 2012), we also performed a paired sample t-test on the
median RTs. This analysis also indicated that participants responded faster in the match condition
(mean median RT = 665 ms) than in the mismatch condition (mean median RT = 689 ms), t(87) =
2.87, p = .005, Cohen’s d = 0.31.

To examine whether there was an association between English language proficiency and
RTs, correlational analyses were conducted. The average LexTALE d’ score was 1.64 (range 0.37-3.35,
mean hit rate = 0.78, mean false alarm rate = 0.24). The results did not show a relationship between
LexTALE scores and the size of the match effect (i.e., the difference in mean RT between match and
mismatch conditions), r(86) = .11, p = .315. Given the difficulty of interprefting null effects, we also

calculated Bayes Factors for correlations (JASP Team, 2023). This analysis indicated moderate
o
r
evidence for the absence of a correlation between LexTALE and the match effect, BF = 4.59 (Figure

overall RTs on critical trials, r(86) = -.24, p = .024, rBF = 1.62 (Figure 2B), indicating that participants

therefore also examined the association between LexTALE scores and RTs using I as a measure of language proficiency

(M = .58, range .15-.93). The results also did not show a relationship between LexTALE scores and the size of the match

The finding of a match effect in Experiment 1 extends previously reported findings in the
-
sentence-picture verification task with native languaege comprehenders (e.g., Zwaan et al., 2002) to
r
non-native speakers, providing support for thPe view that non-native language comprehenders
generate mental simulations in a native-like manner. Thus, in contrast to Norman and Peleg (2022)
l
a
we did find evidence for mental simulations in non-native language comprehension. Experiment 2
n
r
was conducted to see if converging evidence for this claim would be found with a different
u
paradigm. As mentionoed earlier, in the sentence-picture verification task, sentences and pictures are
J
presented in an alternating fashion, which could evoke strategic use of imagery to facilitate
responding to the presented pictures. In this case, the match effect would not reflect naturalistic
language processing. To rule out this alternative explanation of the match effect, a delayed picture
recognition task (Pecher et al., 2009) was used in Experiment 2. As argued by Pecher et al. (2009),
this task provides the opportunity to examine whether mental simulations are generated
spontaneously during language comprehension. In the delayed picture recognition task, participants
receive a surprise memory task after having read all sentences. Because participants are unaware
that their memory will be tested and do not see any of the object pictures before having read all the
sentences, there is no reason to engage in strategic imagery during sentence reading. Crucially, we
assumed that activation of the meaning of a sentence would result in the formation of a memory

17
trace of the activated concepts, and that this trace would reflect the visual simulation of the object’s
shape as implied by the sentence context. Earlier findings of context sensitivity (e.g., Anderson et al.,
1976; Barclay et al., 1974; Barsalou, 1993; Cabeza, 1994; Mulligan et al., 1999; Pecher et al., 2004,
2007; Van Dantzig et al., 2011; Vriezen et al., 1995; Yee & Thompson-Schill, 2016; Zeelenberg, 2005;
Zeelenberg et al., 2003) lead to the hypothesis that a match effect might occur in such a task (i.e.,
better recognition memory performance for matching pictures than for mismatching pictures). If so,
this would provide further evidence for the claim that non-native speakers form mental simulations
f
during language comprehension, and that they do so even under moroe naturalistic comprehension
o
circumstances.

3.1 Method P
3.1.1 Participants l
a
A total of 109 non-nativen speakers of English were recruited for the study. None of the
r
participants in the reported analyses had participated in Experiment 1. The data from 92 participants
u
o
were included in the final statistical analyses (information about exclusion criteria is provided
J
below). All participants were students at the Erasmus University Rotterdam who participated in
exchange for course credit. Participants remaining in the analyses consisted of 83 females (90%), 8
males (9%), and 1 participant who identified with neither gender (1%). Ages ranged from 18 to 44
years old (M = 20.9, SD = 3.2).
The sample Included speakers of 22 different native languages: Dutch (n = 48), German (n =
10), Turkish (n = 4), Spanish (n = 3), Danish (n = 2), Georgian (n = 2), Italian (n = 2), Albanian (n = 1),
Arabic (n = 1), Bosnian (n = 1), Bulgarian (n = 1), Finnish (n = 1), French (n = 1), Greek (n = 1), Hebrew
(n = 1), Hindi (n = 1), Hungarian (n = 1), Romanian (n = 1), Russian (n = 1), Serbian (n = 1), Swedish (n
= 1), Ukrainian (n = 1), and multilingual (n = 6; 2 Dutch/Turkish, 1 Bosnian/Croatian/Dutch, 1
Dutch/Finnish, 1 German/Swedish, and 1 Urdu/Punjabi).

3.1.2 Stimulus Materials
The same sentence quadruplets and filler pictures as in Experiment 1 were used for the
delayed picture recognition task. Sixty nonsense sentences were created to serve as distractors
during the study phase. They were similar to the experimental sentences in length and structure, but
were semantically nonsensical, thus requiring a “no” response (e.g., There was a hill in the glove).
These nonsense sentences mentioned only objects that were not included in the quadruplets nor
the filler pictures. A set of 60 filler pictures was added to serve as distractors for the recognition
f
task. The stimuli for the LexTALE task were the same as those used ino Experiment 1.
o
3.1.3 Procedure
r
p
The procedure for the LexTALE task was identical to that of Experiment 1. After completion
-
e
of the LexTALE task, participants completed the study and test phase of the delayed picture
r
recognition task (Pecher et al., 2009). The stuPdy phase included 30 match sentences, 30 mismatch
sentences, and 60 nonsense filler sentenlces for a total of 120 trials. On each trial, a fixation stimulus
a
(+) was presented in the centre onf the screen for 500 ms, followed by the presentation of a sentence
r
at the centre of the screen until a response was given. Participants indicated whether the sentence
u
o
made sense by clicking on a red no-button or a green yes-button. The next trial started 400 ms after
J
the response.
After completion of the study phase, the delayed recognition phase was initiated. This phase
contained 30 match pictures and 30 mismatch pictures, corresponding to the match and mismatch
sentences from the study phase, as well as 60 non-studied pictures for a total of 120 trials.
Participants were instructed that they would see pictures of objects and their task was to indicate
for each picture if the depicted object had been mentioned in one of the sentences in the sensibility
judgment task. A fixation stimulus (+) was presented in the centre of the screen for 500 ms, followed
by the presentation of a picture until a response was given. Participants indicated whether the
depicted object was mentioned in any of the sentences presented during the study phase by clicking
on a red no-button or a green yes-button. The next trial started 400 ms after the response.

19
During both the study and test phase, participants could take as long as they wanted to
provide a response. Stimuli were presented in a new random order for each participant during each
phase. After completion of the recognition task, participants were asked to provide their gender,
age, and native language. The tasks were administered online using Inquisit Web (Millisecond).
3.1.4 Data Analysis
In total, data from 17 participants were removed from the analysis because of the following
exclusion criteria, a) the participant’s overall d’ was below 0 (n = 4), b) they had already participated
f
in the experiment (n = 2), or c) they reported to be a native speaker oof English (n = 8). To ensure
o
equal numbers of participants in each of the four counterbalanced versions, we excluded data from
r
p
the last tested participants (n = 3) in versions that had more participants than the version with the
-
e
fewest so that 23 participants remained in each version.

3.2 Results and Discussion P
Based on the hit and false alarm lrates in the recognition task, we calculated d’ for match and
a
mismatch pictures using the Snondgrass-Corwin correction (Snodgrass & Corwin, 1988). The mean d’,
r
hit rates, and false alarm rates are presented in Table 4. Participants’ d’s were higher for match than
u
o
mismatch pictures, t(91) = 5.47, p < .001, Cohen’s d = .57. Thus, we replicated the match effect.
z
J
That is, participants had a better ability to discriminate between old (i.e., studied) and new (i.e., non-
studied) stimuli when the shape of the depicted object matched the shape that was implied by the
sentence.

Note. All hit rates, false alarm rates, and d’ values reported in the paper and used in the statistical
analyses were based on values obtained after applying the Snodgrass-Corwin correction.
The average LexTALE d’ score was 1.81 (range 0.42-4.23, mean hit rate = 0.77, mean false
alarm rate = 0.18). Correlational analyses were conducted to examine whether there was an
association between English language proficiency and memory performance. The analysis revealed
f
no significant correlation between LexTALE scores and match effects o(i.e., the difference in d’
o
between match and mismatch conditions), r(90) = -.08, p = .478, BF = 5.97 (Figure 3A) nor between

LexTALE scores and overall d’s, r(90) = .16, p = .128, BF = 2.48 (Figure 3B), indicating no relation

between English proficiency levels and memory performance.3
r
These findings agree with the resultsP for native language comprehenders reported by Pecher
et al. (2009) and suggest that mental simlulations were generated spontaneously during sentence
a
comprehension. Together, the rensults of Experiments 1 and 2 can be interpreted as support for the
r
view that mental simulatiouns are formed in conceptual memory during normal non-native language
o
comprehension.

Correlational analyses were also conducted using I to compute LexTALE scores (M = .60, range .18-1.00). This revealed

no significant correlation between LexTALE scores and match effects, r(90) = -.10, p = .360, BF = 5.08. There was,

4. General Discu-ssion
e
The current study provides evidence for trhe spontaneous activation of mental simulations in
P
non-native language comprehension. In Experiment 1, using the sentence-picture verification task
l
(Zwaan et al., 2002), we found a matach effect. That is, participants were faster to verify that a
n
pictured object was mentioned in the immediately preceding sentence when the shape of the object
r
u
matched the shape implied by the sentence than when the shape of the object mismatched the
o
shape implied by tJhe sentence. In Experiment 2, similar findings were obtained in a delayed picture
recognition task (Pecher et al., 2009). In this task, participants first read all the sentences and were
subsequently tested in a surprise recognition task. Recognition memory was better if the shape of
the picture matched the shape implied by the sentence than if the shape of the object mismatched
the shape implied by the sentence. The findings extend those of Experiment 1 indicating again that
participants generated visual simulations during language comprehension. Because in Experiment 2
sentences and pictures were not presented in an alternating fashion and participants did not know
that their memory would be tested, these results provide additional evidence that the match effect
relies on mental simulations that are generated spontaneously during naturalistic language
comprehension rather than only as a product of strategically deployed imagery (Pecher et al., 2009).
Together, the results of Experiments 1 and 2 indicate that behavioral indices of mental simulations

22
for non-native language comprehension are similar to those that have been previously observed for
native language comprehension.
Additionally, we examined whether the size of the match effects in Experiments 1 and 2
were related to language proficiency yet found no evidence for such an association. Although the
results of Experiment 1 indicated that overall RTs were related to English proficiency levels, the
strength of this relation was weak. Moreover, the association between the size of the match effect
and English proficiency was absent in both experiments. That is, the differences between RTs
f
(Experiment 1) and d’ values (Experiment 2) for the match and mismaotch conditions were not
o
related to English proficiency scores.
r
p
The results from the sentence-picture verification task and delayed recognition task indicate
-
e
that non-native language comprehenders, just as native language comprehenders, generated visual
r
simulations that include information about tPhe shape of objects mentioned in the sentences, even
though object shape was not explicitly delscribed. These findings align with those reported for native
a
language comprehenders by Zwanan et al. (2002; also see Mannaert et al, 2017; Stanfield & Zwaan,
r
2001; Zwaan & Pecher, 2012) and Pecher et al. (2009), and can be accounted for by the perceptual
u
o
symbols theory of conceptual memory (Barsalou, 1999). According to this theory, language
J
comprehenders simulate an actual perceptual encounter with the object that is described, and
different sentence contexts activate different simulations of the same object. This visual simulation
of the sentence content is then used for comparison with the presented object picture, hence when
the shape of the object in the sentence matches the shape of the depicted object, participants
respond faster than when they mismatch. In addition, the results for the delayed picture recognition
task revealed that the visual simulation is encoded in memory.
In both Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 we did not find a correlation between the size of the
match effect and language proficiency (as measured by LexTALE). The lack of an association suggests
that amount of language exposure and degree of mastery of non-native language comprehenders
may not affect the extent of visual simulation during language comprehension. However, this

23
observation must be interpreted with some caution. First, like any measure, LexTALE is unlikely to
fully capture all aspects of language proficiency and may therefore be limited in its ability to predict
the size of match effects. We note, however, that LexTALE scores are reliable and do predict
performance in a variety of language tasks (Lemhöfer & Broersma, 2011). Nevertheless, it might be
fruitful for future studies to use other language proficiency measures in addition to LexTALE. Second,
Hedge et al. (2017) argued that experimental tasks are often not well suited to detect individual
differences. The fact that these tasks are developed to produce robust effects (i.e., have a relatively
f
low between-participant variability), suggests that their reliability foro detecting individual differences
o
is not likely to be very high. As the observable correlation is limited by the reliability of the included
r
p
measures (Spearman, 1904), it is also possible that the lack of correlations between the match
-
e
effects and LexTALE scores underestimate the true correlations because of low reliability of the
r
experimental task.4 It is, however, uncertain Pwhether this is the case, as the reliability of the tasks for
the detection of individual differences is lunknown. As can be seen in Figure 2B and Figure 3B, the
a
match effect size did vary over pnarticipants, however it is unclear to what extent this variation is due
r
to actual individual differences in mental simulation and to what extent it is due to measurement
u
o
error. A comparison of the effect size found here in Experiment 1 (d = 0.22 for mean RTs, d = 0.31
z z
J
for median RTs) with those found in previously published studies using native language
comprehenders provides some additional insight in the potential role of language proficiency. Zwaan
and Pecher (2019), using a different stimulus set, reported effect sizes of d = 0.15 (Experiment 2a)
z
and d = 0.18 (Experiment 2b) for shape match effects in the standard picture-sentence verification
z
task. In another study, using the same stimulus set as the present study, Zwaan et al. (2018)
reported effect sizes of d = 0.22 and d = 0.33 for shape match effects.5 These effect sizes are
z z
4 It might seem odd that a task that has a low reliability can produce robust effects but consider the following. Suppose
that every person in the population has a ‘true’ Stroop effect of 100 ms. Given that an experiment contains a large number
of experimental trials the influence of random noise would be low and all participants would show a Stroop effect in the
order of 100 ms. Obviously, this would produce a robust Stroop effect. In terms of individual differences, however, the
reliability would be extremely low (i.e., 0).
5 Zwaan et al. (2018) retested participants three to four days later in the same experiment. In this second wave they
observed effect sizes of d = 0.66 and d = 0.31.

24
roughly the same size as the one we obtained in Experiment 1. Overall, this lends some support to
the idea that language proficiency may have little effect on mental simulation (with the caveat, of
course, that the language comprehender must know the meanings of the words presented).
Although several researchers have obtained evidence for the use of sensory-motor
simulations during non-native language comprehension (Ahlberg et al., 2018; Bergen et al., 2010;
Dudschig et al., 2014; Wheeler & Stojanovic, 2006), the results in the sentence-picture verification
task have been mixed. Ahn and Jiang (2018) did find a match effect, but with stimulus materials that
f
were not counterbalanced. Chen et al. (2020) and Normand and Peleog (2022), in contrast, did not
o
find a match effect. We note that Chen et al. used a delayed recognition task (as we did in
r
p
Experiment 2) and had a relatively small sample size of 36 participants. Even for native speakers they
-
e
failed to find an effect on hit rates, in contrast to Pecher et al. (2009). It is possible that the low
r
power to detect a statistically significant matPch effect in the Chen et al. study was responsible for
the null finding. Norman and Peleg’s studly had a larger sample size of 80 participants, but they
a
nevertheless did not find a matchn effect in the standard version of the sentence-picture verification
r
task. Although one cannot exclude the possibility that the lack of a significant match effect for non-
u
o
native speakers in their study was due to a type-2 error, other explanations are also possible. One
J
explanation might lie in the fact that the participant samples in our study and that of Norman and
Peleg (as well as some other studies) differed in how regularly the participants use English (De Bruin
& Della Sala, 2016). Our participants use their
