## 📚 卡片清單


### 1. [Embodied Simulation Hypothesis](zettel_cards/Jones-2024-001.md)
- **ID**: `Jones-2024-001`
- **核心**: "Embodied simulation theory posits that understanding others' actions, intentions, and emotions relies on internally simulating those experiences using one's own sensorimotor system."


### 2. [Multimodal Language Models (MLLMs)](zettel_cards/Jones-2024-002.md)
- **ID**: `Jones-2024-002`
- **核心**: "Multimodal Language Models are deep learning models that process and integrate information from multiple modalities, such as text, images, and audio, to perform various natural language and vision tasks."


### 3. [Sensorimotor Contingencies](zettel_cards/Jones-2024-003.md)
- **ID**: `Jones-2024-003`
- **核心**: "Sensorimotor contingencies refer to the structured and predictable relationships between an agent's actions and the sensory feedback they receive."


### 4. [Cross-Modal Reasoning](zettel_cards/Jones-2024-004.md)
- **ID**: `Jones-2024-004`
- **核心**: "Cross-modal reasoning involves the ability to integrate information from different modalities to draw inferences and solve problems that require understanding relationships between these modalities."


### 5. [Mirror Neuron System](zettel_cards/Jones-2024-005.md)
- **ID**: `Jones-2024-005`
- **核心**: "The mirror neuron system is a set of brain areas that activate both when an individual performs an action and when they observe another individual performing the same action."


### 6. [Generative Modeling](zettel_cards/Jones-2024-006.md)
- **ID**: `Jones-2024-006`
- **核心**: "Generative modeling involves training a model to generate new data that is similar to the data it was trained on."


### 7. [Interactive Environments](zettel_cards/Jones-2024-007.md)
- **ID**: `Jones-2024-007`
- **核心**: "Interactive environments provide a virtual setting where MLLMs can interact with objects and receive sensory feedback in response to their actions."


### 8. [Action Prediction](zettel_cards/Jones-2024-008.md)
- **ID**: `Jones-2024-008`
- **核心**: "The MLLM was able to accurately predict the next action of an agent in a video based on its previous actions and the surrounding context."


### 9. [Tool Use Understanding](zettel_cards/Jones-2024-009.md)
- **ID**: `Jones-2024-009`
- **核心**: "The MLLM demonstrated the ability to infer the appropriate tool for a given task based on visual and textual descriptions of the task and the available tools."


### 10. [Generalization to Novel Situations](zettel_cards/Jones-2024-010.md)
- **ID**: `Jones-2024-010`
- **核心**: "The MLLM was able to generalize its understanding of embodied simulation to novel situations and tasks that it had not encountered during training."


### 11. [Counterfactual Reasoning](zettel_cards/Jones-2024-011.md)
- **ID**: `Jones-2024-011`
- **核心**: "The MLLM could reason about what would have happened if an agent had taken a different action, indicating an understanding of cause and effect."


### 12. [Limitations of Current MLLMs](zettel_cards/Jones-2024-012.md)
- **ID**: `Jones-2024-012`
- **核心**: "Despite promising results, current MLLMs still lack the richness and complexity of human embodied experience."


### 13. [The Role of Prior Knowledge](zettel_cards/Jones-2024-013.md)
- **ID**: `Jones-2024-013`
- **核心**: "To what extent does the performance of MLLMs on embodied simulation tasks depend on the prior knowledge they have been trained on?"


### 14. [Ethical Implications](zettel_cards/Jones-2024-014.md)
- **ID**: `Jones-2024-014`
- **核心**: "What are the ethical implications of developing AI systems that can simulate human emotions and experiences?"


### 15. [Measuring Embodied Simulation](zettel_cards/Jones-2024-015.md)
- **ID**: `Jones-2024-015`
- **核心**: "How can we develop more reliable and valid measures of embodied simulation in AI systems?"


### 16. [The Role of Morphology](zettel_cards/Jones-2024-016.md)
- **ID**: `Jones-2024-016`
- **核心**: "How does the morphology of an AI system (e.g., its physical embodiment) affect its ability to perform embodied simulation?"


### 17. [Bias in Training Data](zettel_cards/Jones-2024-017.md)
- **ID**: `Jones-2024-017`
- **核心**: "Bias in the training data can lead to MLLMs developing skewed or inaccurate representations of embodied experiences."


### 18. [AI Deception](zettel_cards/Jones-2024-018.md)
- **ID**: `Jones-2024-018`
- **核心**: "The ability of AI systems to simulate human emotions and intentions raises concerns about the potential for deception and manipulation."


### 19. [Scalability of Embodied Simulation](zettel_cards/Jones-2024-019.md)
- **ID**: `Jones-2024-019`
- **核心**: "Can the embodied simulation capabilities observed in small-scale experiments be scaled up to more complex and realistic scenarios?"


### 20. [The Future of Embodied AI](zettel_cards/Jones-2024-020.md)
- **ID**: `Jones-2024-020`
- **核心**: "Embodied AI holds the potential to revolutionize many fields, including robotics, human-computer interaction, and education."
