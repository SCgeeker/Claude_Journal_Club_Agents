title: "Counterfactual Reasoning"
summary: |-
  "The MLLM could reason about what would have happened if an agent had taken a different action, indicating an understanding of cause and effect."
---

## 說明
The MLLM was able to perform counterfactual reasoning, which suggests that it had developed a causal model of the world and could simulate alternative scenarios.

🤖 **AI**: Does counterfactual reasoning truly require embodied simulation? Or can it be achieved through purely symbolic or logical reasoning processes as is a frequent claim against generative models highlighted in [[Jones-2024-006]]?

✍️ **Human**:



## 待解問題
How can we design experiments to specifically test the role of embodied simulation in counterfactual reasoning?
