title: "The Role of Morphology"
summary: |-
  "How does the morphology of an AI system (e.g., its physical embodiment) affect its ability to perform embodied simulation?"
---

## 說明
This question explores the influence of the physical form of an AI system on its capacity for embodied simulation. It considers whether having a physical body is necessary for true embodied understanding.
