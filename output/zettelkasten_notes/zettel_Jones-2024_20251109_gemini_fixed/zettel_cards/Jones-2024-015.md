title: "Measuring Embodied Simulation"
summary: |-
  "How can we develop more reliable and valid measures of embodied simulation in AI systems?"
---

## 說明
This question focuses on the challenge of developing effective methods for assessing the extent to which AI systems are truly simulating embodied experiences. It considers the limitations of existing metrics and the need for new approaches.

🤖 **AI**: Are current measures of embodied simulation in AI systems too focused on behavioral outputs, and not enough on the underlying cognitive processes? This may obscure important differences between true simulation and mere mimicry as is raised in [[Jones-2024-008]].

## 待解問題
What types of data (e.g., internal representations, neural activity) can provide more direct evidence of embodied simulation in AI systems?
