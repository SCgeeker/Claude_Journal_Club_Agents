title: "Interactive Environments"
summary: |-
  "Interactive environments provide a virtual setting where MLLMs can interact with objects and receive sensory feedback in response to their actions."
---

## 說明
Using interactive environments allows researchers to study how MLLMs learn sensorimotor contingencies and develop embodied understanding through trial and error.
