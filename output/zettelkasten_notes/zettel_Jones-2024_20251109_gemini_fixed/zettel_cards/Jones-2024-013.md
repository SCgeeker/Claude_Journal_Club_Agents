title: "The Role of Prior Knowledge"
summary: |-
  "To what extent does the performance of MLLMs on embodied simulation tasks depend on the prior knowledge they have been trained on?"
---

## 說明
This question explores the influence of the training data on the MLLMs' ability to simulate embodied experiences. It considers whether the models are simply regurgitating learned patterns or developing a more genuine understanding.

🤖 **AI**: If the MLLMs' performance is heavily dependent on prior knowledge, does this undermine the claim that they are truly "simulating" embodied experiences? Perhaps they are simply recalling and adapting previously seen scenarios. This is pertinent to how biases are introduced in [[Jones-2024-017]].

## 待解問題
How can we design experiments to isolate the contribution of prior knowledge to the MLLMs' performance on embodied simulation tasks?
