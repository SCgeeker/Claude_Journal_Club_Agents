title: "Scalability of Embodied Simulation"
summary: |-
  "Can the embodied simulation capabilities observed in small-scale experiments be scaled up to more complex and realistic scenarios?"
---

## 說明
This question addresses the challenge of extending the findings of the study to more complex and realistic settings. It considers whether the MLLMs' performance will degrade as the complexity of the environment increases.

🤖 **AI**: Are the current MLLM architectures and training methods sufficient to handle the scalability challenge? Or will new approaches be needed to achieve embodied simulation in complex and realistic environments? This concern stems from the limitations of current approaches discussed in [[Jones-2024-012]].
