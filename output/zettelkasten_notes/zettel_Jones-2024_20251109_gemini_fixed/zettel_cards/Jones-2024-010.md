title: "Generalization to Novel Situations"
summary: |-
  "The MLLM was able to generalize its understanding of embodied simulation to novel situations and tasks that it had not encountered during training."
---

## 說明
The study found that the MLLM could apply its knowledge of embodied simulation to new and unseen scenarios. This suggests that it had developed a more abstract and flexible understanding of the world.
