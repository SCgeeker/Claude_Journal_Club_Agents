🤖 **AI**: Do MLLMs learn sensorimotor contingencies in a way that is analogous to how humans learn them? Or are they simply learning statistical correlations between actions and sensory inputs, without any true understanding of cause and effect? This is tied to the limitations described in [[Jones-2024-001]].

## 待解問題
How can we design experiments to assess whether MLLMs truly understand sensorimotor contingencies?
