title: "Embodied Simulation Hypothesis"
summary: |-
  "Embodied simulation theory posits that understanding others' actions, intentions, and emotions relies on internally simulating those experiences using one's own sensorimotor system."
---

## 說明
The embodied simulation hypothesis suggests that we understand the world and others by internally replicating experiences. This involves using our own bodies and senses to simulate what others might be feeling or doing. It contrasts with purely symbolic or abstract models of cognition.

🤖 **AI**: The embodied simulation hypothesis, as defined here, seems fundamentally tied to physical bodies. Can a purely digital model, such as a multimodal language model, truly "embody" experiences in a meaningful way? This raises questions about the validity of applying the hypothesis to AI systems, as discussed in [[Jones-2024-012]].
