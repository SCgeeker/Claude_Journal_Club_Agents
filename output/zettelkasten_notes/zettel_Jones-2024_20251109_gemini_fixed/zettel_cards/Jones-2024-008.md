title: "Action Prediction"
summary: |-
  "The MLLM was able to accurately predict the next action of an agent in a video based on its previous actions and the surrounding context."
---

## 說明
The study found that the MLLM could predict future actions by analyzing visual and contextual information. This suggests that it had developed a model of the agent's goals and intentions.

🤖 **AI**: Does the MLLM's ability to predict actions necessarily imply embodied simulation? Or could it simply be learning statistical patterns in the data, without any true understanding of the agent's internal state? This calls into question the core claims made regarding [[Jones-2024-005]].

## 待解問題
How can we distinguish between action prediction based on embodied simulation and action prediction based on statistical pattern recognition?
