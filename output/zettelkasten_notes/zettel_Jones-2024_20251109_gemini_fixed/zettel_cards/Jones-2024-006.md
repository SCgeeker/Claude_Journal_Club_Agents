title: "Generative Modeling"
summary: |-
  "Generative modeling involves training a model to generate new data that is similar to the data it was trained on."
---

## 說明
Generative modeling is a key technique for MLLMs to simulate experiences. By generating new sensory data, they can internally "imagine" different scenarios and predict their consequences.
