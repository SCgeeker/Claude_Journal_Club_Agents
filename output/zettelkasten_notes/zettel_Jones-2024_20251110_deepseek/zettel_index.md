### 1. [Embodied Simulation Hypothesis](zettel_cards/Jones-2024-001.md)
- **ID**: `Jones-2024-001`
- **核心**: "Multimodal language models engage in embodied simulation processes by activating sensorimotor representations during language understanding tasks."


### 2. [Cross-modal Alignment Mechanism](zettel_cards/Jones-2024-002.md)
- **ID**: `Jones-2024-002`
- **核心**: "The model employs contrastive learning to establish vector space mappings between textual descriptors and corresponding visual patterns."


### 3. [Neural Activation Mirroring](zettel_cards/Jones-2024-003.md)
- **ID**: `Jones-2024-003`
- **核心**: "fMRI comparisons revealed significant overlaps between model activation patterns and human sensorimotor cortex responses during action verb processing."
