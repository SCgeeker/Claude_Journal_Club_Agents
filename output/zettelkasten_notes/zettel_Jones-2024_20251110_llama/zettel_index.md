- **ID**: `Jones-2024-009`
- **核心**: "Cognitive science is the study of the human mind and its processes, including perception, attention, memory, language, and problem-solving."


### 10. [Neuroscience](zettel_cards/Jones-2024-010.md)
- **ID**: `Jones-2024-010`
- **核心**: "Neuroscience is the study of the structure and function of the brain and nervous system."


### 11. [Machine Learning](zettel_cards/Jones-2024-011.md)
- **ID**: `Jones-2024-011`
- **核心**: "Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve their performance on a task without being explicitly programmed."
