title: "Counterparts of"
summary: "henduo ‘a lot’ is the Chinese analogue of many and much. It does not simply amount to much, as the Mass Noun Hypothesis predicts, but has the number/quantity duality, as noted in section 2. That is, it pertains to the number of certain things (e.g., cows) when it combines with count nouns, and to the quantity of some stuff (e.g., meat) when it combines with mass nouns: henduo niu means many cows, but henduo rou means much meat."

> **核心**: "henduo ‘a lot’ is the Chinese analogue of many and much. It does not simply amount to much, as the Mass Noun Hypothesis predicts, but has the number/quantity duality, as noted in section 2. That is, it pertains to the number of certain things (e.g., cows) when it combines with count nouns, and to the quantity of some stuff (e.g., meat) when it combines with mass nouns: henduo niu means many cows, but henduo rou means much meat."


## 說明
中文的 "很多" (henduo) 是英文 "many" 和 "much" 的對應詞。與 Mass Noun Hypothesis 的預測相反，"很多" 並不簡單地等同於 "much"，而是具有數量/數量的雙重性。當它與可數名詞結合時，指的是事物的數量 (例如，"很多牛" 指的是 many cows)，而當它與不可數名詞結合時，指的是物質的量 (例如，"很多肉" 指的是 much meat)。

## 個人筆記


**[AI Agent]**: **[AI Agent]**: "很多" (henduo) 的雙重性提供了一個有力的證據，證明中文區分可數和不可數名詞。因為如果中文只有不可數名詞，那麼 "很多" 應該只表示數量，而不是數量。
