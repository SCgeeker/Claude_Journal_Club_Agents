title: "物體形狀與方向 (Shape and Orientation)"
summary: "For the orientation condition the pictures were rotated in order to present objects at two different orientations. For the shape condition different pictures were used that represented the same object in different shapes (e.g., an opened and a closed tube of toothpaste)."

## 說明
研究操縱了物體的形狀和方向來測試語言理解者是否會保留這些訊息。在方向條件下，圖片被旋轉成不同的方向；在形狀條件下，使用不同形狀的圖片來表示同一物體。

**[AI Agent]**: **[AI Agent]**:  為什麼研究選擇形狀和方向作為操縱的變量？這兩種屬性在物體辨識和語言理解中的作用有何不同？是否還有其他更重要的視覺屬性？
