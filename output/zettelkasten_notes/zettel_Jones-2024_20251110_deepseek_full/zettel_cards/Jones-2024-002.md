title: "Cross-Modal Alignment Mechanism"
summary: |-
  "The models learn implicit cross-modal mappings through joint training on visual-textual-auditory streams, creating unified representational spaces."
---

## 說明
This describes MLMs' training methodology where heterogeneous sensory data streams are processed through modality-specific encoders then fused in a shared latent space. The alignment emerges without explicit supervision, suggesting self-organized emergence of embodied representations.

🤖 **AI**: The claim of "implicit" alignment deserves scrutiny. Could latent space organization simply reflect statistical co-occurrence rather than true conceptual mapping? Compare with [[Jones-2024-011]]'s ablation studies.
