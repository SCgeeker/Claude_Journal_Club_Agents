title: "Embodied Simulation in Language Processing"
summary: |-
  "Multimodal language models demonstrate activation patterns in their neural architectures that mirror human sensorimotor processing during language comprehension."
---

## 說明
Embodied simulation refers to the phenomenon where language understanding activates neural representations analogous to real-world perceptual and motor experiences. The paper posits that multimodal language models (MLMs) spontaneously develop these simulation patterns through cross-modal training, replicating human-like cognitive processes observed in neurolinguistic studies.

🤖 **AI**: This claim hinges on anthropomorphic interpretations of neural activations. While intriguing, the analogy risks conflating mechanistic model operations with conscious embodiment (see limitations in [[Jones-2024-012]]). How do we distinguish true simulation from pattern-matching artifacts?

Can disembodied artificial systems achieve genuine simulation, or is physical embodiment prerequisite?
