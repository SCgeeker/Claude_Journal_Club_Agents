title: "Sensorimotor Grounding Hypothesis"
summary: |-
  "Language meaning is fundamentally grounded in neural reactivations of sensory-motor experiences."
---

## 說明
This psychological theory posits that abstract concepts retain traces of their perceptual origins. The paper applies this to MLMs, arguing their multimodal training induces similar grounding despite lacking physical bodies.
