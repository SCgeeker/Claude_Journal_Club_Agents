title: "Metaphor Processing Patterns"
summary: |-
  "MLMs show graded activation intensities in visual cortex analogs when processing metaphors compared to literal language."
---

## 說明
Experimental fMRI comparisons revealed that both humans and MLMs' visual processing modules activate more strongly for metaphorical phrases (e.g., "bright idea") than literal equivalents, suggesting shared embodiment mechanisms.

Do metaphor embodiment patterns transfer cross-linguistically in MLMs?
