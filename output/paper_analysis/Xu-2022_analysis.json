For\nexample, when reading the sentences ‘Laura saw the hawk in the nest’ and ‘Laura saw\nthe hawk in the sky’, the distinctive images of a hawk will be referred to. The former\nsentence activates the image of a hawk with wings folded, whereas the latter one\nshould activate the image of a hawk with wings outstretched. According to theories\nof embodied cognition, perceptual simulation in language comprehension occurs\nbecause conceptual knowledge acquired through sensorimotor experiences can gener-\nate corresponding sensorimotor representations and be stored in an embodied system\n(Barsalou et al., 2008; Louwerse, 2018).

Although perceptual representations of con-\ncepts can be activated automatically in language comprehension, it is not always\nnecessary to reactivate them to their full extent (Dijkstra et al., 2004; Louwerse et al.,\n2015). Considering that these two systems are independent but connected (Mahon,\n2015), the extent of the activation of perceptual representations (e.g., perceptual simu-\nlation) might be influenced by children’s literacy abilities, which correlate intimately\nwith the linguistic representations (Perfetti et al., 2005). However, the relationship\nbetween perceptual simulation and literacy ability in children is inconclusive, based on\nmixed findings from previous work (e.g., Engelen et al., 2011; Tabiee et al., 2021).\nMoreover, as a critical approach to acquiring these perceptual features of concepts,\nbody-object interaction (BOI; Siakaluk et al., 2008) was not controlled in previous stud-\nies. To address these issues, the current study investigated perceptual simulation in\nlanguage comprehension in Chinese children, with the BOI controlled. Meanwhile, as\nan efficient indicator of Chinese children’s general literacy abilities (Ho et al., 2017),\nreading ability at the word level, i.e., Chinese character reading was measured to\nexamine the relationship between perceptual simulation and literacy ability.\nPerceptual simulation in language comprehension\nPerceptual simulation in adults has been demonstrated in studies using a perceptual\nmismatch paradigm across languages (e.g., Dijkstra et al., 2004; Li et al., 2007;\nStanfield & Zwaan, 2001). Typically, in the perceptual mismatch paradigm, participants\nare asked to read and/or listen to a sentence that describes an object in a situation\n(e.g., Laura saw the hawk in the nest). Then, they are asked to respond whether the\nobject in a subsequent picture was mentioned in the preceding sentence. The picture\nis either perceptually (e.g., shape or orientation of the object) matched (e.g., a hawk\nwith wings folded) or mismatched (a hawk with wings outstretched) with the situation\nimplied by the preceding sentence. Although with different perceptual features, the\npicture in either of the two conditions depicts the object (e.g., the hawk) in the sen-\ntence. Thus, the correct response to the respective pictures in these two conditions\nshould be ‘yes’.\nIf processing the sentence will activate specific perceptual representations that are\nconsistent with the situation, a difference in responding to sentence-picture pairs in\nthe two conditions should be observed as the activated perceptual representation\nshould be congruent with the picture in the perceptually matching condition, but not\nin the perceptually mismatching one (Zwaan et al., 2002). In line with this assumption,\na mismatch effect, i.e., participants taking less time to correctly verify the perceptually\nmatching pictures compared with the perceptually mismatching ones, has been\nreported in studies of different sensorimotor aspects, such as shape (Zwaan et al.,\n2002), size (de Koning et al., 2017), colour (Zwaan & Pecher, 2012), orientation\n\nEDUCATIONALPSYCHOLOGY 589\n(Stanfield & Zwaan, 2001), and movement (Glenberg & Kaschak, 2002) during language\ncomprehension.\nThe mismatch effect reflects the extent of the perceptual simulation: a larger\nmismatch effect indicates more reactivation of perceptual representations of con-\ncepts in language processing, e.g., reading and/or listening to sentences (Louwerse\net al., 2015; Zwaan et al., 2002). Neuroimaging studies found that the same sensori-\nmotor modalities (e.g., visual and motor) relating to experiences for concepts, e.g.,\ninteracting with the actual object, can be activated during processing the concepts\n(Binder & Desai, 2011; Sakreida et al., 2013). These findings about the perceptual\nsimulation support that conceptual knowledge can be gained from sensorimotor\nexperiences, which can produce corresponding sensorimotor representations and be\nstored into long-term memory. In turn, these sensorimotor experiences can be reac-\ntivated later to facilitate cognitive processes (e.g., reading) relating to the concept\n(Barsalou et al., 2008).\nThe mismatch effect in children has been revealed in languages such as\nEnglish (Engelen et al., 2011), Dutch (de Koning et al., 2017), and German (Hauf,\net al., 2020; Seger et al., 2020), suggesting that once children have accumulated\nenough sensorimotor experiences, the perceptual representation will be involved\nin language processing (Engelen et al., 2011). However, studies of perceptual\nsimulation in children are still scant in the Chinese language. Similar to in alpha-\nbetic languages, in the Chinese language, conceptual knowledge can be acquired\nfrom sensorimotor modalities through an individual’s interactions with referents in\nthe world (Barsalou, et al., 2008). Furthermore, in the Chinese language, in add-\nition to concrete concepts, abstract concepts can be expressed by concrete\nobjects/events (Yu, 1995). For example, 手足/sau2 zuk1/uses the concepts 手\n(hand) and 足 (foot) to express the meaning of sibling. The concepts regarding\ntaste 辛/san1/(spice) and 苦/fu2/(bit) are compounded to become the word 辛苦\n(exhausting). Although the current study focussed on the perceptual simulation of\nconcrete concepts, such a characteristic of the Chinese language leads to a strong\nconnection between sensorimotor experiences and meanings of concepts (Yu,\n2002). Thus, it is reasonable to assume the existence of perceptual simulation in\nChinese children.\nOn the other hand, concepts have differences in terms of BOI, which is an\nimportant method for obtaining sensorimotor experiences (Siakaluk et al., 2008).\nUsing the BOI ratings of words, i.e., the ease with which a human body can inter-\nact physically with a word’s referent in daily life, earlier studies found that readers\ncould recognise words representing objects with high BOI ratings faster than those\nwith low ratings (Bennett et al., 2011; Siakaluk et al., 2008). In general, objects that\nare used in tasks with the perceptual mismatch paradigm (e.g., Engelen et al.,\n2011; Seger et al., 2020) have different magnitudes concerning the BOI. For\nexample, children may have more bodily interactions with eggs than with eagles.\nThe BOI ratings of concepts may influence the perceptual simulation, however, this\nwas rarely taken into account in the previous studies. Hence, the current study\nmodified the perceptual mismatch paradigm by considering the BOI rating of\n\n590 Z.XUANDD.LIU\nexperimental stimuli to investigate perceptual simulation in language comprehen-\nsion in a stricter way.\nPerceptual simulation and literacy ability\nThe symbol interdependency hypothesis (Louwerse, 2018) suggests that the concept-\nrelated representations from both the linguistic and embodied systems are activated\nautomatically during comprehension. In language processing, these two systems can\nbe activated at the beginning, and the linguistic system peaks before the embodied\nsystem does. Both of these systems can facilitate language comprehension (Mahon,\n2015). The former system relates to linguistic/literacy knowledge (e.g., metalinguistic\nknowledge), while the latter focuses on representations acquired from sensorimotor\nexperiences (Louwerse, 2018). These two systems may also interplay with each other.\nSpecifically, the sensorimotor representation contributes to the construction of con-\ncepts’ meanings (Barsalou et al., 2008), which is related to the semantic constituent of\nword representations (Griffiths et al., 2007). Considering that semantic constituent\nplays a critical role in developing literacy abilities (Perfetti et al., 2005), there might be\na relationship between perceptual simulation and literacy ability in children.\nA few developmental studies have investigated this relationship; however, their\nfindings were mixed. A study in English-speaking children (aged 7–10; Engelen et al.,\n2011) reported similar mismatch effects between children with distinctive reading per-\nformances. The study treated the children with scores of 56 or higher in the word\nreading task as individuals with better literacy abilities, and others as individuals with\npoorer literacy abilities. This dichotomy minimised the variance of literacy perform-\nance, which may have been a reason for their result. Moreover, the study did not con-\ntrol age, which can influence children’s literacy abilities (Perfetti et al., 2005) and the\naccumulation of perceptual experiences (Smith & Gasser, 2005).\nIn contrast, a recent study with Iranian children (Tabiee et al., 2021) found that,\ncompared to age-matched typically developing children, smaller mismatch effects\nwere observed in children with dyslexia (aged 8–13years), who had a poorer literacy\nperformance. This finding lent support for a relationship between perceptual simula-\ntion and literacy ability. However, this finding might be elicited by perceptual deficien-\ncies in the children with dyslexia, rather than the distinctive literacy abilities of these\ntwo groups. It should be noted that, in addition to reading difficulties, children with\ndyslexia generally have problems in perceptual (e.g., visual) processing (Bosse et al.,\n2007), which may impair the acquisition of sensorimotor experiences and the construc-\ntion of perceptual representations. Thus, it is possible that the relationship between\nperceptual simulation and literacy ability in typically developing children without per-\nceptual deficits, which was investigated in the current study, would be different from\nthat found by Tabiee et al. (2021). Such a study could also help us to understand liter-\nacy development better, particularly since perceptual simulation has not been consid-\nered well previously in this area.\nAccording to our understanding, there should be at least two possibilities for the\nrelationship between perceptual simulation and literacy development in Chinese chil-\ndren. One is that larger mismatch effects will be observed in children with more\n\nEDUCATIONALPSYCHOLOGY 591\ndeveloped literacy abilities (i.e., skilled readers). This possibility is related to the\nassumption that skilled readers are supposed to have more linguistic knowledge\n(Perfetti et al., 2005), which can facilitate the connection between linguistic representa-\ntions and corresponding perceptual representations (Smith & Gasser, 2005).\nAccordingly, more connections could make it easier for skilled readers to reactivate\nperceptual representations during language processing than it is for those with less\ndeveloped reading abilities (i.e., less skilled readers).\nAnother possibility is the opposite, that skilled readers will have smaller mismatch\neffects than less skilled readers. The reactivation of perceptual representations can\nfacilitate understanding, but it is not always necessary to reactivate them to their full\nextent for language processing (Louwerse et al., 2015). Consistent with this assump-\ntion, a study with English adults (Dijkstra, et al., 2004) found that younger adults\n(mean age ¼ 18.25) had an overall higher accuracy rate and response speed in a lan-\nguage comprehension task with the perceptual mismatch paradigm than older adults\n(mean age ¼ 74.40) did. However, smaller mismatch effects were observed in the\nyounger group. It is possible that the magnitude of reactivated perceptual representa-\ntions will be smaller if readers have enough linguistic representations for completing a\nreading task. In contrast, since less skilled readers have less linguistic knowledge to\ncomprehend efficiently, they may reactivate more perceptual representations to facili-\ntate processing.\nThe present study\nIn summary, the current study investigated two research questions: (1) whether the\nperceptual simulation in language comprehension would be present in Chinese chil-\ndren; and (2) whether the perceptual simulation would be influenced by the children’s\nliteracy ability. The current study was conducted in Hong Kong, where the first stage\nof literacy acquisition is from Grades 1 to 3. During the first stage of literacy acquisi-\ntion, children are supposed to acquire 65% (i.e., 2,169) of the new characters that they\nshould learn in primary school (Education Bureau, 2007). Given fairly well-developed\nliteracy abilities, with accumulated sensorimotor experiences (Carlisle, 2000; Wellsby &\nPexman, 2014), the end of the first stage of literacy acquisition, i.e., Grade 3, would be\na good point to start the investigation of the relationship between perceptual simula-\ntion and reading ability in Chinese.\nA sentence-picture verification (SPV) task (Engelen et al., 2011) was adopted to\nmeasure children’s perceptual simulation, and the mismatch effect was used as an\nindicator of perceptual simulation. In Chinese, reading ability at the word level, i.e.,\nChinese character reading, has strong correlations with other literacy outcomes such\nas reading fluency and reading comprehension (Ho et al., 2017). It was adopted as an\nindicator to represent children’s general literacy performances. To gain a relatively\ncomprehensive understanding, Chinese character reading was measured twice, with a\none-year interval. That is, both the concurrent literacy ability (i.e., Grade 3) and that of\none year before (i.e., Grade 2) were measured to examine possible relationships\nbetween perceptual simulation and literacy ability. The one-year earlier data could be\nobtained because the data for the present study were from a two-year longitudinal\n\n592 Z.XUANDD.LIU\ndataset, while the mismatch task was only administered in Grade 3. Control factors\nwere the participant’s age, gender, nonverbal intelligence, and working memory, as\nwell as the word frequency and BOI ratings of experimental words and pictures in the\nSPV task, which may impact upon perceptual simulation and its relationship with read-\ning ability (Cain, 2006; Chiu & McBride-Chang, 2006; Wellsby & Pexman, 2014).\nNonverbal intelligence was measured at Grade 2 in the current study as it can predict\nlater reading performance (Ritchie et al., 2015). The testing time for each occasion was\naround 40min.\nMethod\nParticipants\nNinety-six children were recruited from two public primary schools in Hong Kong, and\nwritten informed parental consent was obtained for all participants. All data from\nthree participants were excluded because two of them had overall accuracy lower\nthan 60% on the SPV task; while the other one had low scores on Chinese character\nreading for both occasions (i.e., three standard deviations below the participants’ aver-\nage score). The remaining 93 participants (45 girls) were native speakers of Cantonese,\nand had no physical or mental problems regarding visual, linguistic, or developmental\naspects, according to their teachers and parents. Their mean ages were 8years and\n0.43months (SD¼4.09months) on the first occasion and 9years (SD¼4.07months) on\nthe second occasion. In addition, another 30 third graders were recruited to rate the\nBOI for the experiment pictures and words (i.e., the words of the corresponding\nobjects in the experiment sentences) on the second occasion. These 30 children were\nnot given any of the other measures used in the study.\nProcedure\nData were collected from two-time points. Nonverbal intelligence was measured on\nthe first occasion (i.e., Grade 2), while perceptual simulation and working memory\nwere examined on the second (i.e., Grade 3). The task for literacy ability, i.e., Chinese\ncharacter reading, was conducted on both occasions.\nMeasures\nChinese character reading\nA Chinese character reading task (Liu et al., 2017) was used to examine reading ability\nat the word level, which was used to represent general literacy ability. In this task, the\nchildren were required to read three-character lists aloud, one by one. Each list con-\ntained 72 characters, and the three lists were specific to Grades 1, 2, and 3 in primary\nschool. To measure literacy ability at a more comprehensive level, these lists were con-\nstructed by considering compound/noncompound characters, character frequency,\nfamily size, and family frequency (i.e., the average frequencies of all words with a\ngiven morpheme; Da, 2004). Each list consisted of 16 regular compound characters\n(i.e., pronounced the same/similar as the phonetic in isolation, such as 像/zoeng6/\n\nEDUCATIONALPSYCHOLOGY 593\n(like)), 32 irregular compound characters (i.e., those having a completely different pro-\nnunciation from the phonetic, such as 活/wut6/(life), where the phonetic 舌 is pro-\nnounced as/sit6/(tongue)), 12 simple noncompound characters, such as 在/zoi6/(in),\nand 12 complex noncompound characters, such as 真/zan1/(true). The characters in\neach list were ordered by their rankings in 3,500 frequent Chinese characters (Cai &\nBrysbaert, 2010), and the test stopped when a child failed to recognise 15 consecutive\ncharacters. The average rankings of characters in the three lists were 1,045.6 (range\nfrom 6 to 2,723), 1,103.9 (range from 10 to 3,053), and 1,323.9 (range from 6 to 3,457).\nOne point was given for each correct answer, and thus the maximum score was 216.\nThe same Chinese character reading task was adopted on both occasions. The\nCronbach’s alphas were .98 and .95 for the first and second occasions, respectively.\nSentence-picture verification task\nThe SPV task (Engelen et al., 2011) was used to measure perceptual simulation.\nTwenty-four objects familiar to children (e.g., cat and pen) were selected. Then, 24\nexperimental sentence pairs were constructed, each of which implied a distinct\nshape of the same object, for example, ‘果園裡種著西瓜, a watermelon in a garden’\nand ‘果盤裡放著西瓜, a watermelon on a fruit plate’. In the former sentence, the per-\nceptual matching image was the whole watermelon; in the latter, it was pieces of\nwatermelon. All the sentences were developed with characters selected from the first\npart (i.e., Grades 1–3) of Hong Kong Chinese lexical lists for primary learning (Education\nBureau, 2007) to ensure there were no new characters in these sentences. As well, 24\npicture pairs corresponding to the experimental sentence pairs were developed, and\n24 filler sentences were constructed, all of which were paired with unrelated pictures.\nAll pictures were black-and-white (see Appendix A), drawn by an undergraduate Visual\nArts student.\nAt the same time, the BOI of the experimental words and pictures were rated by 30\nstudents in Grade 3, who were not involved in any of the tasks in the present study\non the second occasion. These children were asked to rate, on a 1–7 scale, how easily\nthey could interact physically with each word’s referent; a rating of 1 was extremely\neasy, and 7 was extremely difficult. For example, it is relatively easy for a child to have\na bodily interaction with a desk, whereas it is more difficult to have one with a tiger.\nEach of the 30 students was asked to give two examples of objects, one with a rela-\ntively high BOI rating and the other relatively low, to ensure the child understood the\ninstruction about rating. The average BOI rating was 4.37 (ranging from 1.19 to 7) for\nthe pictures and 4.72 (ranging from 1.28 to 6.93) for the words.\nTo control the combinations of sentences and pictures, we developed four versions\nof the task, which were counterbalanced among the participants. Each experimental\nsentence was presented with the perceptual matching picture in one version, but with\nthe perceptual mismatching picture in the other version. For each version, the trials\nstarted with the presentation of a fixation cross at the centre of the screen for 250ms,\nwith a ‘beep’ sound (250Hz) to remind the participant that the test was about to start.\nAfter a blank screen for 1,000ms, a written sentence appeared at the centre of the\nscreen for 3,000ms. Simultaneously, the corresponding audio of the sentence was pre-\nsented via a headphone. All of the audio (16-bit stereo, 22,050Hz) was recorded in a\n\n594 Z.XUANDD.LIU\nFigure 1. The procedure of sentence-picture verification task.\nsound-attenuated room by a female native speaker of Cantonese. The mean duration\nof the auditory files was 2,462.33ms (SD¼224.82), ranging from 2,086ms to 3,000ms.\nThe participants were asked to read and listen to the sentence, and the audio could\nassist their comprehension if there were any new characters. Then, one picture\nappeared in the centre of the screen after another blank screen for 1,000ms. After the\nparticipants responded whether the depicted object was mentioned in the preceding\nsentence (‘F’ referred to yes; ‘J’ referred to no), a blank screen was replaced by the\nnext trial after 2,000ms. The participants were encouraged to respond as quickly and\naccurately as possible. The participants began with 10 practice trials consisting of 5\nrelated and 5 unrelated pictures. Next, they completed a sequence of 48 trials, of\nwhich 24 were experimental. Each participant performed 12 matching and 12 mis-\nmatching trials, all requiring affirmative responses. In addition, 24 trials were requiring\nnegative responses. The trials were presented in random order. The experiment took\napproximately 15min to complete. The experimental procedure is illustrated in Figure\n1. The Cronbach’s alphas of the response times were .75 (perceptually matching condi-\ntion) and .71 (perceptually mismatching condition).\nRaven’s standard progressive matrices\nNonverbal intelligence was measured by Sets B and C of the Raven’s Standard\nProgressive Matrices (Raven, 2000). There were 24 items, and the maximum score was\n24 points. For each item, the children were asked to identify the missing element\nfrom six or eight choices according to the corresponding pattern. The Cronbach’s\nalpha was .78.\n\nEDUCATIONALPSYCHOLOGY 595\nTable 1.

That is, the children were asked to recall 14 strings of Arabic digits (e.g.,\n6-7-3) in the reverse order (e.g., 3-7-6) after listening to each string. The digit strings\nranged from two to eight digits long and were arranged in order of increasing length.\nOne score was assigned to each correct answer, with a maximum of 14. The\nCronbach’s alpha was .89.\nData analysis\nLinear mixed models (LMMs), in which all random factors (i.e., individual differences in\nparticipants and stimuli) could be considered simultaneously with fixed effects of inter-\nests, were utilised to investigate the perceptual simulation and its relationship with lit-\neracy ability. The lme4 package and the lmerTest package (Kuznetsova et al., 2017) in\nR 3.4.2 (R Core Team, 2017) were used for the LMM analyses. The log-likelihoods of\nthe models were analysed with the function anova (Pinheiro & Bates, 2000) to produce\nthe chi-square statistics.\nResults\nPreliminary analysis\nFor the SPV task, the average accuracy, including fillers, was .92 (SD ¼ .07), and the d’\nprime was 2.98. The high percentage of correct responses indicates that the partici-\npants understood the procedure adequately, but the fillers were not included in the\nreaction-time analyses. The accuracy was similar across conditions of perceptual simu-\nlation (i.e., matching and mismatching, F ¼ 0.44, p ¼ .51, g 2 ¼ .01), indicating\n(1, 92) p\nthat the participants were equally good at making the correct judgments for the two\nconditions. The analysis of response times excluded all error trials. In addition, all trials\n(4.61%) with response times shorter than 300ms or longer than 3,000ms were\nremoved (Engelen et al., 2011). The response times that were three standard devia-\ntions above or below a participants’ condition mean for correct responses (0.76%)\nwere excluded. The results of the SPV task, Chinese character reading, nonverbal intel-\nligence, and working memory are summarised in Table 1.\n\n596 Z.XUANDD.LIU\nLinear mixed model analysis\nAs there was no significant difference in the accuracy of the perceptual matching and\nmismatching conditions in the SPV task, consistent with the previous studies\n(de Koning et al., 2017; Engelen et al., 2011), we utilised the response times for further\nanalysis of perceptual simulation. A primary LMM model was constructed for percep-\ntual simulation in Chinese children’s language comprehension. The dependent variable\nwas the response time for the correct responses in the SPV task. The perceptual simu-\nlation condition (i.e., matching or mismatching) was entered as a fixed variable. In\naddition, the fixed variables included the covariates, i.e., age, gender, nonverbal intelli-\ngence, working memory, word frequency of the target words in experimental senten-\nces (mean frequency was .07, ranging from .01 to .25), the BOI ratings of the target\nwords and pictures, and the experiment version in the SPV task.\nThe random factors included random intercepts by participants and items. In add-\nition, random slopes of the perceptual simulation condition, the word frequency, the\nBOI ratings of the experimental pictures and words, and the experimental version by\nparticipants, as well as random slopes of age, gender, nonverbal intelligence, and\nworking memory by items were involved. To overcome the problem of collinearity,\nthe continuous variables (i.e., response times, working memory, age, nonverbal intelli-\ngence, word frequency, and the BOI ratings of the experimental pictures and words)\nwere centred by the z-score transformation of raw scores. The primary LMM model\nresults showed that the main effect of perceptual condition was significant; the chil-\ndren needed more time (91.47ms) to respond correctly to the perceptual mismatching\nstimulus than to the perceptual matching one.\nNext, we added Chinese character reading as a fixed continuous factor into the pri-\nmary model to construct the second LMM to investigate a possible role of literacy abil-\nity in the perceptual simulation. The Chinese character reading scores for the first and\nsecond occasions were entered into a longitudinal sub-model and a concurrent sub-\nmodel of the second LMM, respectively. As well, a random slope of the corresponding\nscore of Chinese character reading by items was added into these two sub-models.\nFor the second LMM, the results of its two sub-models were consistent and illustrated\nthat, after adding the Chinese character reading, the effect of the perceptual condition\nwas significant. The effects of Chinese character reading in the two sub-models were\nnot significant, demonstrating that the performance in the language comprehension\ntask in the current sample did not differ across children with different literacy abilities.\nThe chi-square statistics of the models showed that, compared to the primary model,\nthe second model (the longitudinal sub-model: p ¼ .97; the concurrent sub-model: p\n¼ .99) did not lead to a significant improvement.\nTo explore further the possible relationship between perceptual simulation and lit-\neracy ability, we constructed the final LMM by adding the interaction between percep-\ntual condition and Chinese character reading, i.e., perceptual condition(cid:2)Chinese\ncharacter reading (see Appendix B), to the second LMM. Similar to the second LMM,\nthe Chinese character reading scores for the two occasions were entered into the cor-\nresponding sub-models. The results of the two sub-models of the final LMM were con-\nsistent and showed that, in addition to the effect of perceptual condition, the\ninteraction between perceptual condition and Chinese character reading was\n\nEDUCATIONALPSYCHOLOGY 597\nFigure 2. The perceptual simulation of childrenwith differentscores forChinese character reading.\nsignificant. The perceptual simulation correlated negatively with performance on\nChinese character reading; the lower the score for the Chinese character reading task,\nthe larger the mismatch effect (see Figure 2). Moreover, the chi-square statistics for\nthe models showed that the final model (the longitudinal sub-model: p ¼ .02; the con-\ncurrent sub-model: p ¼ .04) led to a significant improvement, whereas the second one\ndid not. That is, the interaction between perceptual condition and Chinese character\nreading had a unique prediction effect on the response time for the SPV task. The\nresults for these three models are summarised in Table 2.\nDiscussion\nThe current study sought to examine the role of perceptual simulation in Chinese-\nspeaking children’s language comprehension and, further, to explore its relationship\nwith children’s literacy abilities. Consistent with the previous studies in alphabetic lan-\nguages (e.g., Engelen et al., 2011; Seger et al., 2020), the current study revealed a sig-\nnificant mismatch effect for perceptual simulation in Chinese children. Moreover, the\nstudy extended the findings of perceptual simulation in children by demonstrating a\nnegative correlational relationship between it and literacy ability. Compared to chil-\ndren who had developed literacy abilities (i.e., those who had higher scores on the\nChinese character reading task in the current study), those with less developed literacy\nabilities presented perceptual simulation to a larger extent in language\ncomprehension.\nPerceptual simulation in language comprehension of Chinese speakers\nOverall, on the perceptual simulation task, the children verified the pictures faster\nwhen they matched perceptually with the preceding sentence than when they were\nmismatched. This result illustrated that, once language processing became effortful,\n\n598 Z.XUANDD.LIU\nTable 2.

The longitudinal sub-model utilised the Chinese character reading score for the first occasion, whereas\nthe concurrent sub-model utilised the Chinese character reading score for the first occasion. BOI of picture\nand BOI of word mean the rating of the body-object interaction for the experimental pictures and words,\nrespectively.\nthe Chinese children could reactivate related perceptual representations of the con-\ncepts (Engelen et al., 2011). In light of these results, it is important to consider the\nrole of perceptual information in the acquisition of concepts and construction of child-\nren’s mental lexicons. When acquiring new concepts, children can integrate linguistic\nsymbols with the corresponding perceptual properties of referents to construct and\norganise the mental lexicon (Smith & Gasser, 2005).\nSpecifically, the perceptual information is involved in the conceptual acquisition\nand the development of mental lexicon at an early stage (Louwerse et al., 2015), that\nis, the mapping of names to objects, for example, the name ‘ball’ to an actual ball.\nAfter learning some individual objects, children need to generalise the structures of\nindividual categories, e.g., the knowledge that all balls are round. Thus, they can rec-\nognise novel balls according to this perceptual property. In turn, the perceptual repre-\nsentation can be reactivated during language comprehension of related concepts. The\n\nEDUCATIONALPSYCHOLOGY 599\ncurrent findings, combined with those of previous studies with Chinese adults (Li\net al., 2007; Wang et al., 2005), highlight the critical role of perceptual representation\nin language comprehension in Chinese.\nRelationship between perceptual simulation and literacy ability in\nChinese children\nThe present study examined the relationship between perceptual simulation and liter-\nacy ability in Chinese children. As an indicator for the general literacy ability, Chinese\ncharacter reading scores for two occasions were adopted to represent the participants’\nearlier (i.e., one year before) and concurrent literacy abilities. The results for the two\noccasions were consistent; i.e., larger mismatch effects of the perceptual simulation\nwere observed in the children with less developed literacy abilities (i.e., lower scores\non the Chinese character reading task in the current sample).\nThis result was inconsistent with that of Engelen et al. (2011), in which children\nwith distinctive literacy abilities showed similar mismatch effects. This might be attrib-\nuted to a difference in approaches; while Engelen et al. (2011) used the dichotomy\napproach to analyse literacy ability, it was investigated individually with the linear\nmixed models in the present study. In addition, the covariates that might influence\nthe relationship, such as age and the BOI rating of concepts were controlled in the\ncurrent study, but not in Engelen et al. (2011). This result was also opposite to the\nfinding of Tabiee et al. (2021). As mentioned before, this might have been because\nthe children with less developed literacy abilities in the Tabiee et al. (2021) study were\nthose with dyslexia. According to previous studies (Bosse et al., 2007), (some) children\nwith dyslexia may also have perceptual (e.g., visual) difficulties, which can lead to\nimpairments in acquiring sensorimotor experiences, which may influence the relation-\nship between perceptual simulation and literacy ability.\nThe present study found that the less skilled readers utilised more perceptual repre-\nsentations for language processing than the skilled readers did. The less skilled readers\nwere supposed to have relatively less developed literacy abilities than the skilled read-\ners did (Perfetti et al., 2005). However, in the current sample, the overall performances\non that task for language comprehension were similar for children with distinctive lit-\neracy abilities. Considering that both linguistic and embodied systems can be reacti-\nvated to assist processing in language comprehension (Louwerse et al., 2015), it is\npossible that, for less skilled readers, more perceptual representations could be reacti-\nvated and utilised to compensate the shortfall of linguistic representations. In contrast,\nthe skilled readers could retrieve enough concept-related representations from the lin-\nguistic system, which peaks before the embodied system does (Louwerse et al., 2015),\nto enable them to give correct responses in the language comprehension task. As a\nconsequence, the mismatch effect was smaller in the children with more developed\nliteracy abilities.\nAn alternative interpretation is related to the feature of the SPV task. Previous stud-\nies have demonstrated that processing linguistic stimuli (e.g., reading/listening to the\nsentence) can activate related perceptual representations; as well, processing percep-\ntual stimuli (e.g., processing the picture) can activate corresponding semantic\n\n600 Z.XUANDD.LIU\nrepresentations (Estes et al., 2008). Thus, there were at least two routes for children to\ncomplete the SPV task. One route focussed on the perceptual representation, utilising\nthe perceptual representation that was reactivated when reading/listening to the sen-\ntence to compare with the perceptual features that were depicted in the subsequent\npicture. The second route related to the linguistic representation, in which the seman-\ntic representation of the object in the picture was compared to the concept in the\npreceding sentence.\nAs described before, in the SPV task, the picture in either condition depicted the\nobject that was mentioned in the preceding sentence. Although the perceptual repre-\nsentation can be reactivated automatically during language comprehension (Barsalou\net al., 2008; Louwerse, 2018), a correct answer can be given without comparing the\nperceptual representations of the sentence-picture pair. Thus, the perceptual represen-\ntations of concepts seem to be irrelevant/inappropriate to the current task, especially\nfor the trials in the perceptual mismatch condition. Previous work found that less\nskilled readers are less competent than their typical counterparts in suppressing dis-\ntracting information while performing some semantic-related tasks (e.g., Chiappe et al.,\n2000). It is possible that the skilled readers may be better at switching to use the\nsemantic route when they find the perceptual features of the picture are inconsistent\nwith the perceptual representation reactivated by the preceding sentence. On the con-\ntrary, the less skilled readers may have difficulties in suppressing the comparison of\nthe perceptual representations, even when they are irrelevant/inappropriate to com-\npleting the task. Thus, the inconsistent perceptual representations of the sentence-pic-\nture pair in the perceptual mismatch condition would increase the difficulty in giving\na correct answer, resulting in a larger mismatch effect. Notably, the current data did\nnot indicate which of the possible interpretations is correct. Future studies are\nrequired to examine the two possible explanations.\nLimitations and future studies\nThis study had some limitations. First, the current findings suggest perceptual simula-\ntion in language comprehension in Chinese children, however, it is still not clear which\nlinguistic components of the sentence are critical for perceptual simulation. Also, it is\npossible that children with distinctive literacy abilities perform differently in recognis-\ning the critical component, which may influence the perceptual simulation. Future\nstudies could manipulate linguistic components (e.g., the object or the situation/\nspace), as well as use the approaches such as eye-tracking or neurological techniques,\nto investigate how and to what extent children can recognise the words included in\nthe task for the perceptual simulation.\nSecond, the interpretation about suppression was based on previous findings about\nthe automatic reactivation of perceptual representations in language comprehension\n(Barsalou et al., 2008) and a better ability to suppress inappropriate information in typ-\nically developing children (Chiappe et al., 2000). Consider the correlation between\nworking memory and the ability of suppression (Cain, 2006), we further examined the\nrole of working memory in the relationship between perceptual simulation and literacy\nability (see Appendix C). The results did not show any effects of working memory on\n\nEDUCATIONALPSYCHOLOGY 601\nthe perceptual simulation or its relationship with literacy ability (ps > .05). However,\nto examine this interpretation empirically, future studies could add a task to measure\nchildren’s inhibition control for inappropriate information in language comprehension.\nThird, a larger sample size with different age groups should be included in future\nstudies to explore the development of perceptual simulation and its relationship with\nliteracy ability. As well, reading tasks with different difficulty levels (e.g., language\ncomprehension at the next level), which could yield a larger effect size for perceptual\nsimulation factors than for linguistic statistic factors (Louwerse et al., 2015), could be\nused to test whether this relationship will be different.\nFinally, to reduce the influence of the stimuli, the current study utilised concepts\nthat are familiar to children. Also, only one type of interval was included in the pre-\nsent study to provide enough time for children to comprehend a sentence (Engelen\net al., 2011). However, shorter intervals could impact the perceptual simulation (e.g., Li\net al., 2007). Future studies should involve concepts with different levels of familiarity,\nas well as different intervals in the SPV task to investigate whether the relationship\nbetween perceptual simulation and reading will be different.\nTheoretical and educational implications\nConsistent with the symbol interdependency hypothesis (Louwerse et al., 2015), the\ncurrent study demonstrated the perceptual simulation in Chinese children’s language\nprocessing. Moreover, the current study illustrated that the extent of perceptual simu-\nlation could be modulated by differences in children’s literacy performances (i.e.,\nChinese character reading). Specifically, since children with less developed literacy abil-\nities have relatively less linguistic knowledge, they can reactivate more perceptual rep-\nresentations to construct a relatively complete situation model to facilitate language\ncomprehension. On the other hand, children with more developed literacy abilities\nmay have enough linguistic knowledge to support efficient processing. Accordingly,\nfewer perceptual representations are reactivated for language processing. At the same\ntime, it is possible that children with more developed literacy abilities can suppress\nthe goal-irrelevant information more easily and switch to symbolic knowledge to com-\nprehend language once they find embodied information inconsistent with the seman-\ntic cues.\nPractically, the current study suggests that corresponding perceptual information\nshould be involved in children’s concept acquisition, to enhance the representations\nof these concepts. Moreover, the relationship between perceptual simulation and liter-\nacy ability supports that teaching approaches should be varied for children with differ-\nent literacy abilities. That is, in addition to integrating the symbolic and sensorimotor\ninformation of new characters, the control of inhibiting irrelevant and/or inappropriate\ninformation should be involved in literacy acquisition, especially for readers with poor\nliteracy performances.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank allthechildren, theirparents andteachers, fortheirparticipation.\n\n602 Z.XUANDD.LIU\nDisclosure statement\nNo potentialconflict of interestwasreportedbytheauthor(s).\nFunding\nThis study was partially supported by the General Research Fund of the Hong Kong Special\nAdministrative Region Research Grants Council(HKIED:GRF18404114).\nORCID\nZhengye Xu http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6738-8060\nDuo Liu http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2352-2616\nData availability statement\nThe data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author\nupon reasonable request.\nReferences\nAlloway, T., & Alloway, R.
