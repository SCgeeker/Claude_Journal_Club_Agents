Introduction\nPrevious studies on Mandarin Chinese classifiers and measure words have come\nup with drastically different inventories. One crucial factor for the huge\n1\n\n2 One-Soon Her and Wan-Jun Lai\ndiscrepancies is whether classifiers (C), as in (1), and measure words (M), as in\n(2), can be meaningfully and accurately distinguished.\n(1) a. 一百 尾 金魚\nyibai wei jinyu\n100 C goldfish\n‘100 goldfish’\nb. 三 根 鉛筆\nsan gen qianbi\n3 C pencil\n‘3 pencils’\nc. 十 匹 馬\nshi pi ma\n10 C horse\n‘10 horses’\n(2) a. 一百 箱 金魚\nyibai xiang jinyu\n100 M-box goldfish\n‘100 box of goldfish’\nb. 三 公斤 香蕉\nsan gongjin 鉛筆\n3 M-kilo pencil\n‘3 kilos of pencils’\nc. 十 群 馬\nshi qun ma\n10 M-herd horse\n‘10 herds of horses’\nEven for those that do support a formal C/M distinction, such distinctions\nhave not been made explicit, and many works on C/M simply assume that C and\nM are distinguishable and distinguish the two rather subjectively. An informal\nbut insightful characterization is offered in Tai and Wang [1, p.38]:\nA classifier categorizes a class of nouns by picking out some salient\nperceptual properties, either physically or functionally based, which are\npermanently associated with entities named by the class of nouns; a\n\nClassifiers in Taiwan Mandarin 3\nmeasure word does not categorize but denotes the quantity of the entity\nnamed by noun.\nFor natural language processing, how to make a formal distinction is\nobviously an important issue, as one of the most distinctive characteristics of\nChinese is the C’s, not the M’s. For example, in a machine translation system for\nChinese and English, most C’s in Chinese have no counterparts in English, while\nmost M’s do, and for the reverse direction, most M’s in the English [Num M of N]\nconstruction can receive straightforward translations in the Chinese [Num M N]\nconstruction, but the English [Num N ] sequence must be turned into [Num C\ncount\nN] in Chinese, where the insertion and choice of C affects grammaticality and\nfacility.\nIn spite of the same syntactic position C/M occupy in the [Num C/M N]\nsequence, in this paper we will fully justify the C/M distinction from three\nperspectives: semantic, mathematical, and cognitive. Section 2 first summarizes\nthe explicit tests developed in [2] based on C/M’s semantic distinction. Section 3\nthen characterizes the C/M distinction in set-theoretic terms. In section 4, we\nfollow [2] and [3] and propose that C/M both function as a multiplicand\nmathematically, with Num as the multiplier, where C is necessarily of the value 1\nand M is not. From a cognitive linguistic point of view, section 5 then approaches\nthe issue from the standpoint of cognitive linguistics and shows that the\nsemantically and mathematically null C nonetheless functions to profile an\ninherent semantic aspect of the head noun. This strict distinction of C versus M\nmakes it possible to identify true classifiers in a language. A report is given in\nsection 6 on the classifiers identified from the category of ‘general measure\nwords’ listed in 國語日報量詞典 Mandarin Daily News Dictionary of Measure\nWords [13], a dictionary based on Taiwan Mandarin data in the Sinica Corpus.\n2. Formal Tests to Distinguish Classifiers and Measure Words\nHer and Hsieh [4] observe that the two formal tests, i.e., de-insertion and\nadjectival modification, which proponents for the C/M distinction proposed\npreviously, have been shown to be unreliable [5][6]. However, based on the\ninsight that M, but not C, constitutes a barrier to numeral quantification and\nadjectival modification, they refine the previous two tests and come up with\nmuch more reliable and accurate formulations (Test A, B). They also restate ge-\nsubstitution as a heuristic (Test C) and observe that temporary measure words are\noften restricted to the number yi ‘one’ (Test D).\nTest A: Numeral/Adjectival Stacking\n(1) If [Num X Num Y N] is well-formed, then X = M and Y = C/M.\n\n4 One-Soon Her and Wan-Jun Lai\ne.g., 一箱十個蘋果, 一箱十包蘋果 vs. *一顆十包蘋果, *一顆十粒蘋\n果\n(2) If [Num A-X N] = [Num X A-N] semantically, then X = C and X ≠ M.\ne.g., 一大顆蘋果 = 一顆大蘋果 vs. 一大箱蘋果 ≠ 一箱大蘋果\n(3) Given antonyms A and A , if [Num A -X A -N] is semantically\n1 2 1 2\nwell-formed, then X = M.\ne.g., *一大顆小蘋果 vs. 一大箱小蘋果\n(4) If [A-X de N] is semantically equivalent to [A-N], then X = C.\ne.g.,大顆的蘋果 = 大蘋果 vs. 大箱的蘋果 ≠ 大蘋果\nTest B: De-insertion\nTest: [yi M/*C de N]\ne.g., 一箱(的)蘋果 vs. 一顆(*的)蘋果\nTest C: Ge-substitution\nTest: If [Num X N] = [Num ge N] semantically, then X = C.\ni j i j\ne.g., 十粒蘋果 = 十個蘋果 ≠ 十箱蘋果\n3. Semantic Distinction between Classifiers and Measure Words\nHer and Hsieh [4] further employ the Aristotelian distinction between essential\nand accidental properties as well as the Kantian distinction between analytic and\nsynthetic propositions to characterize the C/M distinction: C is semantically\nredundant; M is semantically substantive. Precisely, C indicates an essential\nproperty of the noun, and can be paraphrased as the predicate concept in an\nanalytic proposition with the noun as the subject concept; M indicates an\naccidental property in terms of quantity, and can be restated as the predicate\nconcept in a synthetic proposition with the noun as the subject concept. Given\nthis characterization, M can be demonstrated to be more of a content word, thus\nopen to innovations, while C is more a function word, thus forms a closed set\nresistant to innovations.\nThe semantic distinction of C/M can receive a mathematical interpretation\nin set-theoretic terms. In short, properties denoted by C do not contribute to the\ntotal compositional semantic content of the phrase. M, on the other hand, is\nsemantically substantive in [Num M N] and thus does contribute semantic value\nspecific to M only. This contrast can be made explicit in terms of set theory.\nC/M Distinction in Set-theoretic Terms\nGiven a well-formed phrase [Num K N], X the set of\nproperties denoted by K, and Y the set of properties denoted\nby N, K is C if X Y; otherwise, K is M.\n⊂\n\nClassifiers in Taiwan Mandarin 5\nThe fact that C does not contribute any semantic value to the semantics of\nthe overall [Num C N] phrase is not because it has no semantic value itself;\nrather, again, it is because it does not contribute any semantic property that the\nnoun does not already possess. This total overlap of semantic properties between\nC and N is the reason why modification or quantification on C is also on N. M,\non the other hand, does contribute semantic properties to the [Num M N] phrase\nthat N does not possess, and any modification or quantification on M thus does\nnot extend to N. Therefore, the following three expressions with the same Num\nand N share exactly the same truth value, i.e., three fish, in spite of the different\nC’s: 三隻魚san zhi yu = 三條魚san tiao yu = 三尾魚san wei yu; yet, with each\nC replaced with a different M, each expression now has its own unique truth\nvalue, e.g., 三磅魚san bang yu ‘three pounds of fish’ ≠ 三箱魚san xiang yu\n‘three boxes of fish’ ≠ 三打魚 san da yu ‘three dozens of fish’.\n4. Classifiers and Measure Words as Multiplicands\nMost importantly, extending and integrating Landman’s [7] view of C/M as\nparcelers, Borer’s [7] insight that classifiers in Chinese and the plural suffix /-s/\nfunction the same as dividers, and Au Young’s [9][10] findings of the\nmathematical multiplication basis of classifiers, we propose that there is a\nmultiplication relation between Num and C/M, i.e., [Num C/M] = [multiplier ×\nmultiplicand], but the crucial C/M distinction in terms of their mathematical\nvalue is that C’s value is necessarily 1, and M’s value is not necessarily 1, thus\n~1. In other words, an M can have any mathematical value, permanent or\ntemporary, numerical or non-numerical, as long as it is not necessarily 1, while a\nC must always be translated to the numerical value of 1 and 1 only.\nThe mathematics proposed here that C is the multiplicand of the value 1 also\nformalizes the long-standing view that C serves to individuate the following N\n(e.g., [11] and [12]). Furthermore, the mathematics of C/M also provides another\nexplanation why expressions with the same Num and N shall have the same truth\nvalue regardless of the different C’s used, e.g., again, 三隻魚san zhi yu = 三條\n魚san tiao yu = 三尾魚san wei yu, but the same is not true for M, e.g., again, 三\n磅魚san bang yu ‘three pounds of fish’ ≠ 三箱魚san xiang yu ‘three boxes of\nfish’ ≠ 三打魚 san da yu ‘three dozens of fish’.\nThus, C, as the (redundant) multiplicand 1, can be omitted, if stylistically\nrequired, without affecting the truth value of the nominal phrase, but M cannot.\nMathematical Distinction of C/M\nGiven [Num X N], X = C iff X =1; otherwise, X = M.\ne.g., [五張餅 = 五×1餅 = 五餅] vs. [五打餅 = 五×12餅 ≠ 五餅];\n[二條魚 = 二×1魚 = 二魚] vs. [二斤魚 = 二×斤 魚 ≠ 二魚]\n\n6 One-Soon Her and Wan-Jun Lai\nUnder this view of simple mathematics, the many classifiers in Chinese,\nwhile denoting an intricate system of classifying nouns, can be seen as many\nways to profile some intrinsic semantic aspects of the nouns and ultimately the\nmathematical value of one. The concept of profile will be presented in the next\nsection. This mathematical interpretation of C/M further explains why C, as the\nsuperfluous multiplicand 1, may be optional, while M is obligatory, and also why\nC is semantically null and thus transparent to numeral quantification and\nadjectival modification, while M is not. Finally, note that under this mathematical\ninterpretation of C/M, English lacks measure words altogether, given the fact that\nits multiplicand is restricted to 1 and grammaticalized as the nominal suffix -s\nand thus no longer part of the numeral and must be part of the head noun. Thus,\nBorer [8], contra to common misconceptions, is exactly right that English plural\nmaker /-s/ is a C. We thus follow through and claim that while English plural\nsuffix /-s/ is a C similar to the Chinese generic C ge, English has no measure\nwords and putative M’s should in fact be treated simply as common nouns.\nDistinction between Chinese and English\nChinese: [Num X N], X=1 (C) or ~1 (M)\ne.g., 3 × 1book = 三本書; 3 × pile book = 三堆書\nEnglish: [Num X N], Num>1 and X=1 (C)\ne.g., 3 × 1book = 3 –s book = 3 books; 3 × 1pile = 3 –s pile = 3 piles\n5. Classifiers as Profilers\nBesides the functions of a pacrcler [7], divider [8], and multiplicand [9][10],\nwhich C/M have in common, C, being semantically and mathematically\nredundant, is shown to have the unique function as a profiler [13]. The notion of\nprofile/base segregation has a strong connection to gestalt psychology, a\ncomprehensive model of perception organization. Langacker [14] illustrates the\nnotion of domain/profile by the example of circle/arc.\n(a) CIRCLE (b) ARC\ndomain: space domain: circle\n\nClassifiers in Taiwan Mandarin 7\nSimilarly, Hsieh [6] and Her [3] argue that in a [Num C N] phrase, N can be\nseen as the base, or likewise the ‘frame’, in the sense of Fillmore’s frame\nsemantics [15], and C the profile. Below, in the example of 一把壺 yi ba hu ‘a\nteapot’, it is shown that the teapot provides the frame or base for ba to profile, or\nto highlight, the handle, an inherent semantic feature of teapot.\nbig opening lid\nhandle\nsmall opening\ndiscrete unit round shape\nUnder this view, the classifiers’ function of classification is merely a by-\nproduct of their function as profilers. This thus explains at least partially why in\nChinese or any other classifier language, there are always numerous\nidiosyncrasies or gaps in the noun classes categorized by classifier. 1\n6. Identifying True Classifiers in Taiwan Mandarin\nBased on the discussions above, we are now able to properly define C/M, both\noccurring between Num and N and serving as the multiplicand mathematically,\nwith Num as the multiplier. However, C serves as an individuating unit, which\nalso must profile a (bundle of) inherent semantic feature(s) of an N that denotes\nan intrinsically discrete entity; thus, mathematically, C’s value is necessarily\nnumerical and precisely 1. M, on the other hand, whose mathematical value can\nbe anything except 1 and thus may or may not be numerical, provides a\nmeasuring unit of N and thus does not profile any inherent semantic feature of\n1 For a full exploration of the profiler analysis of classifiers, refer to the thesis by Hsieh [13], for\nwhich the first author of this current paper served as the adviser.\n\n8 One-Soon Her and Wan-Jun Lai\nthe N. Consequent of these properties, C/M can be distinguished by the formal\ntests developed in section 2.\nOnly with such a precise characterization of C, is it feasible and practical to\nattempt a comprehensive list of C’s in a language. However, we do not intend to\nprovide such a comprehensive list of C’s in Taiwan Mandarin and will only\nattempt a partial list based on Mandarin Daily Dictionary of Chinese Classifiers\n[16] (MDDCC hereafter). 2 MDDCC was compiled with data from the Academia\nSinica Balanced Corpus of Modern Mandarin Chinese, a corpus that largely\nreflects Taiwan Mandarin. Seven categories of measure words (C/M) are\nidentified, and the first category, called 一般量詞yiban liangci ‘general measure\nwords’, is intended to be precisely what is defined as C in this paper. Table 1\nshows the 173 C’s listed in MDDCC. 3\nTable 1: 173 Classifiers listed in MDDCC\nba3把 dian3點 hang2行 ke1顆 pi3匹 tao4套 zhao1招\nban1班 die2疊 hao4號 ke4客 pian1篇 ti2題 zhen1針\nban3版 ding3頂 hu4戶 ke4課 pian4片 tiao2條 zheng4幀\nban4瓣 ding4錠 hui2回 kou3口 piao4票 tie4帖 zhi1支\nbang1幫 dong4棟 huo3夥 kuai4塊 pie3撇 ting3挺 zhi1只\nben3本 du3堵 ji2級 kuan3款 pou2抔 tou2頭 zhi1枝\nbi3筆 duan4段 ji2集 kun3捆 qi2畦 tuan2團 zhi1隻\nbing3柄 dui1堆 ji2輯 lan2欄 qi2期 tuo2坨 zhi3紙\nbu4部 dui4隊 ji4記 li4粒 qi3起 wan1彎 zhou2軸\ncai2槽 dui4對 ji4劑 lian2聯 qu3曲 wan1灣 zhu1株\nce4冊 duo3朵 jia1家 liang4輛 quan1圈 wan2丸 zhu4柱\nceng2層 fa1發 jia4架 lie4列 que4闋 wei3尾 zhu4炷\nchong2重 fang1方 jian1間 liu3綹 qun2群 wei4位 zhuo1桌\nchu4處 fang2房 jian4件 lu4路 shan4扇 wei4味 zong1宗\nchuan4串 fen4分 jie1階 lun2輪 shen1身 xi2席 zu3組\nchuang2床 fen4份 jie2節 luo4落 sheng1聲 xi2襲 zun1尊\nchuang2幢 feng1封 jie2截 lyu3旅 shou3首 xian4線 zuo4座\ncong2叢 fu2服 jie4介 lyu3縷 shu4束 xiang4項\ncu4簇 fu2幅 jin4進 mei2枚 shuang1雙 ye4頁\ncuo1撮 fu4副 jing1莖 men2門 si1絲 ye4葉\n2 For example, in this paper we will not discuss event measure words, another class identified in\nMDDCC, even though many of them can also be found to be genuine C’s. For a more\ncomprehensive inventory of C’s in Taiwan Mandarin, the reader is referred to the second author’s\nMA thesis [19], for which the first author again served as the advisor.\n3 In the introduction section of MDDCC, it is stated that a total of 174 general measure words are\nlisted in the dictionary. However, we were able to find only 173 of them, in spite of repeated efforts.\n\nClassifiers in Taiwan Mandarin 9\nda3打 gan3桿 ju4句 mian4面 sou1艘 yuan2員\ndai4 代 gen1根 ju4具 ming2名 suo3所 ze2則\ndai4帶 ge個 juan3卷 pai2排 tai1胎 zha1紮\ndang3檔 gu3股 juan4卷 peng3捧 tai2台 zhan3盞\ndao4道 gua4掛 ke1科 pi1匹 tan1攤 zhang1張\ndi1滴 guan3管 ke1棵 pi1批 tang2堂 zhang1章\nIn one the introduction sections of MDDCC, entitled The Usage and\nClassification of Measure Words, the editors in fact offer no explicit criteria for\nthe selection of these 174 C’s. The only relevant characterization is this:「一般\n量詞是最典型的量詞…和數詞搭配用來記量物品的數量」(General measure\nwords are the most prototypical measure words…they collocate with numbers\nand are used to count the number of things ) [16, p.10-11]. One of the several\nexamples given in this section, 蔥兩把 cong liang ba ‘green-onions, two\nhandfuls’, in fact involves 把ba ‘handful’ as an M, not C.4 A more serious\nmisconception is the inclusion of measure words that refer to groups or\ncollections: 「…有些一般量詞則是用來記量物品組成集合後的數量，如\n「一群人、一對手錶、一束花、一批外套」。」(…some of the general\nmeasure words, however, refer to a collection of entities, for example, ‘a group\nof people’, ‘a pair of watches’, ‘a bundle of flowers’, and ‘a batch of coats’.) [16,\np.11]. These are M’s, not C’s, as the reader can run the tests and find out, for they\nall have mathematical values that are not 1 and do not profile any inherent feature\nof the N. Thus, it seems that, like most, if not all, previous inventories of C’s, the\nselection in this dictionary is also based on rather subjective judgments.\nAccording to [17], a paper co-authored by the first editor of the dictionary,\nthere are two ways to distinguish C/M that can be found in the relevant literature.\nOne is by way of the de-insertion test, where a [Num C] sequence resists de-\ninsertion, while -de can be freely inserted after [Num M]. Recent works, most\nnotably [4], [5], and [18], have proven this test highly unreliable, using both\ncorpus data and solicited data. What we have adopted in this paper is Test B in\nsection 2, where only the Num 1, thus [yi C], is found to be resistant to de-\ninsertion. The other criterion advocated in [17] is based on the informal\ncharacterization by Tai and Wang [1], quoted in section 1, i.e., C categorizes a\nparticular type of N and also picks out a salient property of N, but M does not.\nThese informal criteria can be rather subjective. In comparison, our methodology,\nwhile maintaining Tai and Wang’s [1] conception of C/M distinction and\nreinterpreting it in terms of the concept of profiling, employs the three sets of\nformal tests developed in section 2 and also the mathematically precise test that\nC has the exact value of numeral 1 and M does not.\n4 把ba can indeed be a C and profiles the part of an article that functions as a handle, e.g., 一把刀\nyi ba dao ‘one knife’.\n\n10 One-Soon Her and Wan-Jun Lai\nWe have therefore carefully re-examined the 173 items and come up with a\nrevised list of true classifiers. In order to be more accurate, Table 2 shows the 76\nitems that are C’s and C’s only, and Table 3 shows the 21 items that can function\nas both C’s and M’s. Thus, out of MDDC’s 173 putative C’s, all together only 97\nare confirmed to be genuine C’s. A total of 76 items in MDDC’s 173 C’s are in\nfact M’s, not C’s, as shown in Table 4.\nTable 2: 76 Classifiers out of the MDDCC’s 173\nyi1 ben3 shu1 yi1 jian4 da4yi1 yi1 ting3 ji1qiang1\nben3本 jian4件

Concluding Remarks\nThe precise distinction of classifiers (C) and measure words (M) in a classifier\nlanguage like Chinese is an important issue for natural language processing, as\none of the most distinctive characteristics of Chinese is its C’s, not its M’s. For\nexample, in a machine translation system for Chinese and English, most C’s in\nChinese have no counterparts in English, while most M’s do, and in the reverse\ndirection, while most M’s in English can receive straightforward translations in\nChinese, [Num N ] sequences must be turned into [Num C N] in Chinese.\ncount\nThe insertion of a semantically appropriate C is crucial for grammaticality as\nwell as facility. Based on Her and Hsieh’s [4] insight that M in a Chinese [Num\nC/M N] phrase is semantically substantive, while C is semantically redundant\nand thus does not block the numeral quantification or the adjectival modification\nto the noun, this paper further proposes a formal distinction of C/M from a\nmathematical perspective. Synthesizing the concepts of parceler [7], divider [8],\nand multiplicand [9][10], we follow [2] [3] and propose that while C/M both\nfunction as a multiplier mathematically, C’s value is necessarily 1 and M is not,\nthus ~1. The semantically null C nonetheless functions to profile an inherent\nsemantic aspect of N. Finally, based on these strict distinctions of C versus M, a\n\nClassifiers in Taiwan Mandarin 15\nreport is given on the true classifiers identified in國語日報量詞典 Mandarin\nDaily News Dictionary of Measure Words [16].\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank the anonymous reviewers and the audience of CLSW2011 as well as\nthe guest editors and the two anonymous reviewers of this IJCPOL special issue\nfor their insightful comments.
