This paper argues that Chi-\nnese draws a syntactic, as well as semantic, distinction between mass and count\nnouns, and suggests how the approach taken to clarify the distinction can be\nextended to other classifier languages.\nKeywords: classifier, count noun, mass noun hypothesis, number, quantity,\nquantifier, measure word\n1. Introduction\nIt is usual to distinguish common nouns into mass and count nouns.1 The\ndistinction was first drawn by Otto Jespersen in The Philosophy of Gram-\nmar (1924, pp. 198ff & 200f), a work on the principles of grammar that\nfocuses on English and some other related languages. The distinction in\nEnglish and the like is closely related to the disparity between two kinds\nof numeral noun phrases (in short, NNPs) that can be found in those lan-\nguages:\n(1) a. three cows\nb. three liters of milk\nThe count noun cow, taking the singular or plural form, can combine\nJournal of Cognitive Science 10: 209-225, 2009\n©2009 Institute for Cognitive Science, Seoul National University.\n1 I use mass noun interchangeably with non-count noun, and noun with common\nnoun.\n07Yi_Re_사.indd 209 2010-01-11 오후 4:32:19\n\n210 Byeong-Uk Yi\ndirectly with numerals. It yields (1a) by combining with three. The mass\nnoun milk, by contrast, cannot combine with numerals without the aid of\nmeasure words, e.g., liter. It yields (1b) by combining with three via liter.\nBut some languages seem not to allow NNPs of the same structure as (1a).\nThere are languages that use additional expressions called (numeral) classi-\nfiers2 in their translations of, e.g., (1a), which makes the translations draw a\nsyntactic parallel to their translations of, e.g., (1b) (see Tables 1 & 2 in sec-\ntion 2). Such languages, called classifier languages, include Chinese, Japa-\nnese, Korean, Thai, and many other East and Southeast Asian languages.\nMany linguists, philosophers, and anthropologists appeal to this feature of\nclassifier languages, together with a few other features that they seem to\nshare, to hold the Mass Noun Hypothesis:3\nMass Noun Hypothesis:\n(MH1) Classifier languages have no count nouns.\n(MH2) All the common nouns of classifier languages are mass nouns.\nOn their view, all the NNPs of those languages involve classifiers because\ntheir nouns, being mass nouns, require measure words to combine with\nnumerals. This is now the standard view on classifier languages.\nBut I think it is a mistaken view based on superficial examinations of clas-\nsifier languages. The linguistic distinction between mass and count nouns is\nclosely related to the ontological distinction between stuff and individuals,\nand that between the quantity (i.e., amount) of stuff and number of indi-\nviduals.4 Many studies of animals’ and human infants’ cognition of number\nsuggest that humans conceive individuals and their numbers differently\nfrom stuff and its quantity without or before acquiring languages.5 More-\n2 See Aikhenvald (2003) for a survey on classifiers. I use classifier interchange-\nably with numeral classifier.\n3 See, e.g., Quine (1969b, p. 35ff), Hanson (1976; 1983), Allan (1977), Sharvy\n(1978), Link (1998, p. 214ff), Lucy (1992, p. 89), Gil (1992, p. 324), Krifka (1995),\nChierchia (1998), and Borer (2005, p. 93f).\n4 I use quantity interchangeably with amount. Note that quantity or amount per-\ntains to individuals as well as stuff. Cows, as well as water, have weight and volume.\n5 See Dehaene (1997, Part I) for a survey on the animal and human cognition of\n07Yi_Re_사.indd 210 2010-01-11 오후 4:32:19\n\nChinese Classifiers and Count Nouns 211\nover, some recent studies show that both English- and Japanese-speaking\nchildren, as early as when they are two years old, have a grasp of the stuff/\nindividual distinction, and use it to learn the meanings of nouns (see Soja et\nal. (1990), and Imai & Gentner (1997)).6 And I think there is good linguistic\nreason to think that classifier languages, too, distinguish mass and count\nnouns. So I propose a conjecture opposite to the Mass Noun Hypothesis:\nCount Noun Hypothesis:\n(CH1) Classifier languages have count nouns as well as mass nouns.\n(CH2) T hey have morphosyntactic devices for distinguishing count\nnouns from mass nouns.\nThis paper aims to support this hypothesis with a close scrutiny of Chinese.\n2. Classifier Languages and the Mass Noun Hypothesis\nClassifier languages, or many of them, share several features that some\nmight take to support the Mass Noun Hypothesis. To get an idea of the\ngrounds for the hypothesis, it is useful to note the devices commonly used\nto draw the distinction for English:7 (a) the grammatical number distinction\n(or the singular-plural morphology); (b) the indefinite article a/an; (c) many\nand much; few and little; (d) quantifiers: each, every, several, etc.; and (e)\nnumerals: one, five, a score of, etc. Most of the above-mentioned devices\nhave no counterparts in classifier languages, such as Chinese, Japanese,\nKorean, or Thai. (a*) These languages draw no grammatical number distinc-\ntion. (b*) They have no articles. (c*) And they have no exact counterparts of\nmany and much, which pertain to number and quantity, respectively. Instead\nthey have one word that amounts to a lot: the Chinese henduo, Korean\nman(h)-, etc. Those words have the number/quantity duality, and cover both\nmany and much. (And it is the same with their analogues of few and little.)\nnumber.\n6 Two year old English-speaking children have not yet acquired the morphosyn-\ntactic devices necessary for distinguishing English count nouns from mass nouns.\n7 See, e.g., Pelletier & Schubert (2003, p. 250f) for a standard presentation of the\ndistinction.\n07Yi_Re_사.indd 211 2010-01-11 오후 4:32:19\n\n212 Byeong-Uk Yi\nMoreover, nouns of classifier languages, it seems, cannot directly com-\nbine with numerals.8 Consider the following translations of three cows into\nthe above-mentioned languages:\nTable 1. Translations of ‘Three Cows’\nKorean Japanese Chinese Thai\nso sey mali ushi san tou was saam tua\ncow three CL cow three CL cow three CL\nsey mali-uy so san tou-no ushi san tou niu\nthree CL-gen cow three CL-gen cow three CL cow\nIn addition to the counterparts of cow and three, these phrases have the\nclassifiers that match nouns for animals: mali (Korean), tou (Japanese), tou\n(Chinese), and tua (Thai). This makes the translations of three cows draw\nsyntactic parallels to the translations of, e.g., three pounds of meat into the\nsame languages:\nTable 2. Translations of ‘Three Pounds of Meat’\nKorean Japanese Chinese Thai\nkoki sey kun niku san paundo nua saam pon\ncow three pound meat three pound meat three pound\nsey kun-uy koki san paundo-no niku san bang (de) rou\n3 pound-gen meat 3 pound-gen meat 3 pound (de) meat\nFor the classifiers used in the former take the positions of the measure\nwords in the latter.\nWhat does all this mean? Some argue that it supports the Mass Noun\nHypothesis. They assume that the classifiers in the translations of three\n8 Although this is commonly held, it is not quite correct because classifiers are not\nmandatory in many classifier languages. In addition to the two forms of NNPs list-\ned in Table 1, Korean, for example, has two classifier-free forms: (i) Num+N, and\n(ii) N+Num. See, e.g., Martin (1992, p. 171ff), Sohn (1999, p. 352f), Lee & Ramsey\n(2000, p. 97ff), and Lee & Chae (2002, p. 143) for discussions of the various forms\nof Korean NNPs. Note that the existence of classifier-free forms of NNPs in a clas-\nsifier language militates against the Mass Noun Hypothesis.\n07Yi_Re_사.indd 212 2010-01-11 오후 4:32:20\n\nChinese Classifiers and Count Nouns 213\ncows, like measure words, pertain to the measurement of the quantity of\nstuff, and conclude that the counterparts of cow are mass nouns. They argue\nthat this is why those nouns call for the additional items, classifiers, in\nNNPs, and that it can explain other notable features of classifier languages\nas well: the grammatical number system, indefinite article, and counterparts\nof many and few would play no role in languages with no count nouns.\nBut this argument for the Mass Noun Hypothesis has a conspicuous prob-\nlem. Languages with all the above-mentioned features might have other\ndevices that one can use to distinguish count nouns from mass nouns. In\nparticular, they might have counterparts of quantifiers listed in (d): each,\nevery, several, etc. I shall argue that Chinese, like many other classifier lan-\nguages, has count nouns because it has a counterpart of each (viz., geh 各)\nthat selects count nouns.9 Before I do so, it is useful to examine a different\nattempt to draw the mass/count distinction for Chinese.\n3. Chao on Chinese Classifiers and Count Nouns\nYuen Ren Chao (1968, p. 507ff) distinguished Chinese nouns into mass\nand count nouns more than four decades ago. (He uses an apt term for\ncount nouns, individual noun.) Although his formulation of the distinction\nhas some infelicities, I think it eventually leads to one successful formula-\ntion.\nChao draws a “formal” or syntactic distinction between mass and count\nnouns of Chinese. To do so, he formulates two tests for count nouns:\n(C1) “ Mass nouns do not take the individual classifier” ge, 個 (ibid., p.\n508f).\n(C2) B etween the numeral phrase of the form Num+CL*10 and the\nnoun N, “one can insert an optional de for mass nouns but not for\nindividual nouns”, i.e., count nouns (ibid., p. 509).\n9 I discuss geh in section 4. It is homonymous with the classifier ge, 個, discussed\nin section 3, and both are spelled ge in pinyin. To avoid confusion, however, I fol-\nlow Chao (1968) in romanizing the former as geh.\n10 I use ‘CL*’ for the category of numeratives that includes classifiers and mea-\nsure words. See note 11 below.\n07Yi_Re_사.indd 213 2010-01-11 오후 4:32:20\n\n214 Byeong-Uk Yi\nI think (C2) is wrong. But I think (C1), Chao’s main criterion recently redis-\ncovered by Zhang (2009), leads to one good test for count nouns.\nLet us first see why (C2) fails. To do so, it is useful to consider Chao’s\ndistinction of numeratives, which include classifiers and measure words.11\nHe (ibid., p. 584ff) distinguishes eight kinds thereof. They include: (a) (indi-\nvidual) classifiers or individual measures (e.g., tou (CL:animal)); (b) group\nmeasures (e.g., zu ‘group’); (c) partitive measures (e.g., fen ‘portion, share’);\n(d) container measures (e.g., wan ‘bowl’); and (e) standard measures (ma\n‘yard’).12 The category of classifiers (or “individual measures”) is closely\nrelated to that of count nouns (or “individual nouns”). Chao says that count\nnouns “are [in general] associated with their specific classifiers, so that in\ndictionaries the specific classifier must be cited under each individual noun\nto identify its class” (ibid., p. 507). Now, some of the non-classifier numera-\ntives (e.g., the group measure zu ‘group’) can match nouns to be considered\ncount nouns (e.g., niu ‘cow’) to yield NNPs with de (e.g., san zu de niu ‘three\ngroups of cows’). So (C2) is false.13\nBut I think (C1) yields a good test for Chinese count nouns. According to\n(C1), the classifier ge is not applicable to mass nouns: shui ‘water’, niunai\n‘milk’, rou ‘meat’, etc. If so, nouns that can take ge must be count nouns. It\n11 Many Chinese linguists (e.g., Cheng & Sybesma) use classifier broadly to in-\nclude all measure words, without distinguishing classifiers and measure words. But\nChao (1968, p. 584ff) uses measure word (or measure) broadly, and classifier for just\none of the eight kinds of “measures” that he distinguishes. I follow Chao in using\nclassifier in its narrow and proper sense (I do not think classifiers pertain to measure-\nment of quantity), but use measure (word), too, in its narrow and proper sense. For\nI think there is an important contrast between classifiers in the proper sense and the\nEnglish measure words (and their classifier language counterparts). I use numerative\nas a broad term that covers both classifiers and measure words (and some others).\n12 The other three kinds are: classifiers associated with V-O constructions, tempo-\nrary measures, and quasi-measures.\n13 Chao (1968, pp. 555 & 588) formulates a modification of (C2): classifiers can-\nnot take de. Cheng & Sybesma (1998; 1999) use this as their main test for classi-\nfiers (which they call count-classifiers). But Chao, unlike Cheng & Sybesma, does\nnot hold that it gives a sufficient condition for classifiers; some group measures\n(e.g., dui ‘pair’), he says, cannot take de. See Zhang (2009) for other problems with\nCheng & Sybesma’s tests for classifiers.\n07Yi_Re_사.indd 214 2010-01-11 오후 4:32:20\n\nChinese Classifiers and Count Nouns 215\nis straightforward to extend this test to Japanese and Korean, which have\ncognate classifiers, ko (or -tu) and kay, respectively. I recently came to inde-\npendently realize that the cousin of (C1) holds for Korean, and learned from\nNiina Zhang (p.c. Jan. 1, 2009) and Takashi Iida (p.c. Jan. 5, 2009) that (C1)\nand its Japanese cousin hold for Chinese and Japanese, respectively, as well.\n(Thanks are due to them.)\nWhether or not a noun can take ge, however, would seem to have noth-\ning to do with the usual mass/count distinction for non-classifier languages\n(e.g., English). If so, what is the reason for taking the ge test to pertain to\nthe mass/count distinction, rather than to a distinction between two kinds of\nmass nouns? To answer this question, it is necessary to give an account of\nthe function of the classifier.\nTo do so, it is useful to compare ge with some of the group measures: dui\n‘pair’, shuang ‘pair’, and da (Chinese transliteration of the English dozen).\nTheir English counterparts figuring in two pairs of pigeons, several doz-\nens of classifiers, etc. can match only count nouns. (Note that Pelletier &\nSchubert (2003, p. 250f), for example, lists their sibling, scores of, as one\nof the counting phrases, which cannot match mass nouns.) Similarly, those\nChinese group measures can match only count nouns.14 Now, the group\nmeasures can be considered cousins of numerals, namely, grammatical-\nized versions of numerals that might apply only to certain things that meet\ncertain conditions. Two pairs of shoes, pigeons, or pebbles are four (i.e., two\ntimes two) shoes, pigeons, or pebbles that meet certain conditions. Just as\npair relates to two, so do dui (or shuang) and da relate to two and twelve,\nrespectively. It is the same, I think, with ge (and other classifiers) except\nthat they relate to one.\nTo see this, note that the talk of a pair or dozen of certain things presup-\nposes the talk of individuals that form the pair or dozen: individual shoes,\nindividual pigeons, individual pebbles, etc. The classifier ge relates to this\nvery notion of individual, which contrasts with the notion of group or of all\nthe things belonging to a group. Accordingly, the Chinese word ge is also\nused as an adjective meaning individual, and as the first component of the\nnoun for individuals: ge.ti, which literally means individual body; and it is\n14 Note that this by itself suffices to show that Chinese has count nouns. See the\nfirst paragraph of section 4.\n07Yi_Re_사.indd 215 2010-01-11 오후 4:32:20\n\n216 Byeong-Uk Yi\nthe same with its Japanese and Korean cognates. Now, the notion of indi-\nvidual does not pertain to mass nouns. We do not talk of individual water,\nbecause water does not relate to a group to which individuals belong – the\nrelation that a portion of water some has to water differs from the relation\nthat an individual cow has to a group of cows (or to all the cows). So a\nmass noun cannot take ge, and taking ge is a mark of count nouns. Given\nthe connection between ge and the notion of individual, we might say that\nthe phrase yi ge gezi (one CL pigeon ‘one pigeon’), for example, means\none individual pigeon. This does not mean that ge, used as a classifier, is an\nanalogue of the English adjective individual. Here again, comparison with\ndui, shuang, and da is useful. The classifier, like these group measures, is\na cousin of numerals, namely, a grammaticalized version of the numeral\nfor one. To say that something is yi ge gezi is to say that it is one times one\npigeon (i.e., one pigeon). The classifier relates to the notion of individual\nthrough its connection to the notion of one. For to be an individual pigeon,\nfor example, is to be one pigeon or one of the pigeons.\nIt is the same, I think, with other classifiers, which, like ge, are called\nindividual measures in contrast to group measures by Chao. One of the\nclassifiers is zhi (CL:one-of-a-pair), which relates to one of a pair of certain\nthings (e.g., a hand). It is a version of the numeral for one that is applicable\nto something only if it is (or is considered as) one of two things that form a\npair. So it has a clear relation to dui or shuang ‘pair’.\nThe specific classifier tou, for example, which applies only to animals,\nis a grammaticalized version of yi ‘one’ that has restricted application. It\nmight be useful to compare this with the English pronoun she (or he). The\nlatter might be semantically decomposed into two parts: the pure pronoun\npart, and the part relating to its restriction to females (or males). In some\nlanguages, the decomposition is transparent: the Korean counterpart of she,\nku.nye, has two morphemes: ku, which indicates the pronoun function, and\nnye, which comes from the noun for females. Classifiers, I suggest, work\nlike English demonstratives she, rather than its Korean counterpart, in the\nway it marks the restriction on their use.\nNow, does Chinese have an unrestricted cousin of yi ‘one’, a classifier that\ncan be used for things of any kind whatsoever? Such classifiers are called\ngeneral classifiers, and they are classifiers that can match any count noun.\n07Yi_Re_사.indd 216 2010-01-11 오후 4:32:20\n\nChinese Classifiers and Count Nouns 217\n(Mass nouns, recall, take no classifiers.) Chao, it seems, holds that ge is\nsuch a classifier:\n(C1*) T he classifier ge “is applicable to all [count] nouns” (ibid., p.\n588).\nThis, together with (C1), yields a syntactic characterization of Chinese\ncount nouns:\n(C) A noun (of Chinese) is a count noun if, and only if, it can take ge.\nWhether (C1*) holds, however, seems to be controversial. To discuss\nwhether it holds or not, we would need an independent condition for count\nnouns. (Chao’s second test for count nouns, (C2), might have yielded such\na condition, but we have seen that (C2) does not hold.) We will see a few\nindependent conditions for count nouns in section 4. For now, however, we\ncan approach the question by noting that the following holds for the reason\nexplained above:15\n(C3) A noun (of Chinese) is a count noun if it has a specific classifier.\n(Also recall that nouns that can take dui ‘pair’, shuang ‘pair’, da ‘dozen’,\netc. are count nouns.) If so, can one use ge in place of any specific classi-\nfier? Chao gives a somewhat cautious answer to this question: the classifier\nge “is a possible alternate for almost any . . . classifier” (ibid., p. 508; my\nitalics). Here he seems to envisage possible exceptions to (C1*), although he\ndoes not give any specific exceptions. Li & Thompson (1981) do not give a\ncompletely positive answer to the question, either. They say ge “is gradually\nbecoming the general classifier and replacing the more specialized ones”\n(1981, p. 112). If so, it might not yet have become the general classifier.16\n15 See Chao’s passage on classifiers and count nouns (ibid., p. 507) quoted in the\nthird paragraph of this section.\n16 Although Korean has a cognate classifier, kay, and it is often said to be a gen-\neral classifier, it applies only to nouns for inanimate things, not to, e.g., kwun.in ‘sol-\ndier’. See Lee & Ramsey (2000, p. 88). Youngwha Kim (p.c. July 11, 2009) confirms\n07Yi_Re_사.indd 217 2010-01-11 오후 4:32:21\n\n218 Byeong-Uk Yi\nWhether (C1*) holds or not, we can formulate an alternative that pre-\nserves its spirit:\n(C1**) A noun (of Chinese) is a count noun only if it can take a classi-\nfier.\nThis holds because a count noun takes either a specific classifier or else ge.\nMost count nouns have classifiers specific to them, and count nouns with no\nspecific classifiers, as Chao says, can take ge (ibid., p. 508).17 This yields the\nfollowing characterization of count nouns:\n(C*) A noun (of Chinese) is a count noun if, and only if, it can take a\nclassifier.\nFor mass nouns can take neither ge nor any other classifiers, which also\npertain to individuals: individual persons, individual animals, etc. The Chi-\nnese noun shui ‘water’ and niunai ‘milk’, for example, can take no classifier,\nbecause the notions of individual and one pertain no more to these than to\ntheir English counterparts.\nThis means, note, that the proper use of ge, be it a general classifier or\nnot, requires distinguishing count nouns from mass nouns. Chinese speak-\ners must understand the distinction to decide whether or not to use ge for\nnouns with no specific classifiers: if they are count nouns, one can use ge as\na back-up; if not, one cannot do so.\n4. Count Nouns of Chinese\nI think (C*) encapsulates an important insight. Note that it does not rest\nthis with various examples; and Chungmin Lee (p.c. July 11, 2009) points out that\nkay is used as a general classifier in children’s speech. But the Chinese ge is used\nmuch more widely, as Zhang (2009) shows. Martin (2004, p. 768) says the Japanese\n-tu is a general classifier.\n17 So we might say that ge is a generic classifier, one that can be used when no\nspecific classifier is available, whether or not it is a general classifier. I think its Ko-\nrean cognate, kay, is a generic, but not a general, classifier.\n07Yi_Re_사.indd 218 2010-01-11 오후 4:32:21\n\nChinese Classifiers and Count Nouns 219\non what one calls classifiers. Whether one calls them count-classifiers,\nsortal classifiers, individual measures, individual classifiers, or simply\nclassifiers is irrelevant. The crucial point is that among the numeratives\nof Chinese (or any other classifier language), there is a distinct group that\nincludes those that relate to the notion of individual via the notion of one,\nand thus pertain only to a special group of nouns that can be called count\nnouns (Jespersen) or individual nouns (Chao). Proponents of the Mass\nNoun Hypothesis deny this. They hold that all nouns of classifier languages\nare mass nouns because there are no numeratives that relate to the notion\nof individual. But this is clearly wrong. Some of the siblings of classifiers,\nsuch as dui/shuang (‘pair’) or da (‘dozen’), have transparent connections to\nEnglish expressions that relate to the notion of individual through their con-\nnection to numerals (e.g., ‘pair’ or ‘dozen’).\nWe can now see that the Mass Noun Hypothesis results from applying\na wrong model of numeratives to classifiers. Clearly, the ‘gallon’ or ‘cup’\nmodel fails to apply to English counting expressions, such as ‘pair’, ‘dozen’,\nor ‘score’. If so, it is wrong to assume that the model applies to all numera-\ntives of classifier languages, including classifiers. It does not apply to the\nChinese counterparts of ‘pair’ and ‘dozen’, and there is no reason to take\nclassifiers to be closer to ‘gallon’ or ‘cup’ than to ‘pair’ or ‘dozen’. The Chi-\nnese NNP san tou niu (three CL cow ‘three cows’), for example, draws no\nmore syntactic parallel to three gallons of milk or three cups of water than\nto three dozens of cows (or three dozen cows). And there are many good\nreasons to compare classifiers to ‘pair’ or ‘dozen’, as we have seen.\nApplying the ‘pair’ or ‘dozen’ model to classifiers, one can reach the\naccount of classifier presented in section 3: classifiers, like ‘dozen’, can\nmatch only count nouns. I think the account is on the right track. But it\nhas limitations in relating the mass/count distinction drawn for Chinese to\nthe distinction drawn for non-classifier languages. (C*) characterizes count\nnouns by invoking a special group of numeratives, viz., classifiers. So it\nfails to yield a syntactic characterization of Chinese count nouns–unless\none can supplement it with a syntactic characterization of classifiers.18 More\n18 Chao’s modification of (C2) mentioned in note 13 is meant to give such a char-\nacterization of classifiers, but it fails to yield a correct characterization of classifiers\n(see note 13).\n07Yi_Re_사.indd 219 2010-01-11 오후 4:32:21\n\n220 Byeong-Uk Yi\nimportantly, even if one can give such a characterization of classifiers, it is\nnot clear how (C*), as supplemented with the characterization, relates to the\nusual characterization of the mass/count distinction for non-classifier lan-\nguages. In this connection, it is useful to note that compare it with (C). (C)\nyields a correct syntactic characterization of Chinese count nouns provided\nthat the classifier ge has become a general classifier. Even if this holds,\nhowever, it would be due to an accidental feature of ge. So one cannot auto-\nmatically extend (C) to other classifier languages, even those with cognates\nof ge (e.g., Korean), to give syntactic characterizations of their count nouns.\nIt would be much harder to link (C) or (C*) to the usual characterizations of\ncount nouns for non-classifier languages.\nSome might suggest that this is unavoidable. They might hold that there\nis bound to be a substantial gap between the mass/count distinction for clas-\nsifier languages and the distinction for the other languages because one can-\nnot characterize count nouns of classifier languages without invoking the\ndistinction between classifiers and other numeratives. Aikhenvald seems to\nsuggest this when she says “In numeral classifier languages, the distinction\nbetween countable and uncountable nouns is realized through classifiers and\nquantifiers [i.e., some of the other numeratives]” (2003, p. 249). Cheng &\nSybesma are more explicit. They hold that in Chinese, “the count-mass dis-\ntinction is grammatically encoded at the level of the classifiers [i.e., numera-\ntives]” (1998, p. 410) because “in a language without number morphology,\nthe semantic [character] of count nouns is not made visible . . . except by\nusing [numeratives]” (1999, p. 520; my italics). I disagree.\nAlthough Korean linguists do not usually draw the mass/count distinc-\ntion for Korean, some of them argue that the distinction applies to Korean\nas well.19 Most of the devices that they invoke to draw the distinction for\nKorean are not classifiers or other numeratives, and they have more trans-\nparent connections to the devices used in the usual mass/count distinction.\nMoreover, I think some of those devices have counterparts in many clas-\nsifier languages. Let me give a brief sketch of the Chinese counterparts of\nsuch devices.\nFirst, Chinese has the adverb geh ‘each’, the counterpart of the English\n19 See, e.g., Kang (1994, p. 3), Noma (2002, pp. 276f & 292), and Yi (2008; 2009).\nKang (1994) gives references to earlier works.\n07Yi_Re_사.indd 220 2010-01-11 오후 4:32:21\n\nChinese Classifiers and Count Nouns 221\ndeterminer each used adverbially, as in, e.g., ‘They have each decided,\nhaven’t they?’ Like each, geh can help to create contexts that admit only\ncount nouns. Consider, e.g., the following sentence:\n(2) Niu (dou) geh you changchu he duanchu.\ncow (all) each have strength and shortcoming\n‘ Each cow has strengths and shortcomings.’\nJust as the underlined cow can be replaced only by count nouns, so can the\nunderlined niu be replaced only by count nouns. Second, Chinese, like any\nother languages, has size adjectives: da ‘big’, xiao ‘small’, etc. And size\nadjectives, as Bunt (1985, p. 199) notes, cannot combine with mass nouns\n(*big water, for example, is not well-formed).20 Third, henduo ‘a lot’ is the\nChinese analogue of many and much. It does not simply amount to much, as\nthe Mass Noun Hypothesis predicts, but has the number/quantity duality, as\nnoted in section 2. That is, it pertains to the number of certain things (e.g.,\ncows) when it combines with count nouns, and to the quantity of some stuff\n(e.g., meat) when it combines with mass nouns: henduo niu means many\ncows, but henduo rou means much meat. Now, the quantifier cannot have\nthis duality unless Chinese has count nouns as well as mass nouns. And the\nresolution of its duality when it combines with nouns yields a distinction\nbetween mass and count nouns.21\nThese devices, as I have noted, are the Chinese counterparts of devices\nfound in Korean. I think the same devices can be found in Japanese and\nmany other classifier languages as well. In fact, I find it hard to imagine\nfull-blown languages with no such devices whether they employ classifiers\nor not. This is the grounds on which I propose the Count Noun Hypothesis:\n20 Thanks are due to Chungmin Lee for pointing this out, and to Niina Zhang for\nreference to Bunt (1985).\n21 There are some devices specific to Chinese. Chinese counterparts of this water\nand this cow, for example, have an interesting disparity: the counterpart of this cow\nhas a classifier, but the other does not. One can explain this by appealing to the fact\nthat the Chinese nouns shui and niu (‘water’ and ‘cow’) are mass and count, respec-\ntively. See my “Towards count nouns of classifier languages: the Chinese route”,\nunpublished manuscript.\n07Yi_Re_사.indd 221 2010-01-11 오후 4:32:21\n\n222 Byeong-Uk Yi\nclassifier languages not only have count nouns as well as mass nouns, but\nhave devices that one can use to draw a syntactic distinction between the\ntwo kinds of nouns.\nThose who hold the opposite hypothesis, the Mass Noun Hypothesis,\nassume that all numeratives of classifier languages have the same function,\nthat they specify the units for measuring quantities. But this assumption is\nclearly wrong. Just as it is wrong to take ‘pair’, ‘couple, or ‘dozen’ to have\nthe same function as ‘liter’, ‘pound’, or ‘cup’, so is it wrong to take clas-\nsifier language counterparts of the former to have the same function as\nclassifier language counterparts of the latter. And there are good reasons, as\nwe have seen, to take classifiers to be closer to the former than to the lat-\nter. This leads one to the view that classifiers are cousins of the numerals\nfor one, namely, their grammaticalized forms. To say that some things are\nthree pairs of cows, for example, is say that they are three times two cows\n(that satisfy some extra conditions). Similarly, to say that some things are\nsan tou niu ‘three CL cow’, for example, is to say that they are three times\none cows (that satisfy some extra conditions). If so, taking classifiers is a\nmark of count nouns just as taking the counting phrases (e.g., ‘pair of’ or\n‘dozen of’) is a mark of count nouns. Then languages with classifiers must\nhave count nouns. And Chinese, we have seen, has some other expressions\nthat can combine only with count nouns, such as geh ‘each’ and da ‘big’.\nJust as ‘*big water’ and ‘*Each water is thirst-quenching’ are ill-formed, so\nare their Chinese counterparts. I suggest that the situation is essentially the\nsame with other classifiers languages. And I leave it for another occasion\nto spell out the details by examining the devices for distinguishing count\nnouns from mass nouns in other classifier languages, and to fully develop\nthe account of the function of classifiers sketched in this paper.\nAcknowledgments\nI wish to thank all the many scholars who helped me while I was working\non the topics of this paper.
