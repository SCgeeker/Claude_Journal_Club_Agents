Introduction\nThe notions of individuals, kinds and events are three useful, albeit abstract,\nsemantic distinctions found in formal semantic theories. These concepts usually\ninvolve separate domains of inquiry within formal semantics, but Lyons (1995),\n* Correspondingauthor.Fax:+886-2-2785-6622.\nE-mailaddress:churen@gate.sinica.edu.tw(C.-R.Huang).\n0388-0001/03/$-seefrontmatter#2003ElsevierScienceLtd.Allrightsreserved.\ndoi:10.1016/S0388-0001(02)00021-9\n\n354 C.-R.Huang,K.Ahrens/LanguageSciences25(2003)353–373\nsummarizes the prevailing viewpoint concerning these concepts in the two passages\nbelow.\nThroughoutthisbookIhaveadoptedtheviewpointofnaı¨verealism,according\nto which the ontological structure of the world is objectively independent both\nofperceptionandcognitionandalsooflanguage....Accordingtotheviewpoint\nadopted here, the world contains a number of first-order entities (with first-\norder properties) which fall into certain ontological categories (or natural\nkinds); it also contains aggregates of stuff or matter (with first-order proper-\nties), portions of which can be individuated, quantified, enumerated—and thus\ntreatedlinguisticallyasentities—byusingthelexicalandgrammaticalresources\nof particular natural languages. All natural languages, it may be assumed,\nprovide their users with the means of referring to first-order entities and\nexpressing propositions which describe them in terms of their (first-order)\nproperties, actual or ascribed, essential or contingent: such languages have the\nexpressivepower offirst-orderformallanguages(p. 325).\nIn the above passage, Lyons argues for the existence of kinds and individuals, as\nwell groups of individuals that can be apportioned. These concepts are available to\nallhumanlanguages,andalllanguagesthathavetheseconceptsareconsideredtobe\nfirst-orderformallanguages.\nLyons is less certain about the concept of event being present in all natural lan-\nguages, asthe followingpassage shows:\nWhether all natural languages have the greater expressive power of various\nkinds of higher-order formal languages is a more controversial, and as yet\nempiricallyunresolved,question. But some natural languages certainly do; and\n[such languages enable] users to reify, or hypostatize, the properties of first-\norder entities, the relations that obtain among them, and the processes, activ-\nities, and states of affairs (and other kinds of situations) in which they are\ninvolved(p. 325).\nHigher-order languages, then, allow users to understand abstract concepts as con-\ncrete (i.e. through metaphorization). Higher-order languages can also describe the\nevents in which first-order entities are involved. Lyons argues that English is a\nhigher-order language.\nIt is interesting to note that Lyons rejects the notion that there is an underlying\nlinguistic or cognitive motivation for the concepts of individuals, kinds and events\n(i.e. ‘the ontological structure of the world is objectively independent both of per-\nception and cognition and also of language’). Moreover, these three concepts are\ntreatedasdistinctbyformalsemanticists,andnotaspartofaunifiedsystem.Butwe\nwill show in this paper that these concepts are part of a coherent and conceptually\nmotivatedgrammaticalsystem.Wewillshowthatindividuals,kinds,andeventsare\nreflected in the classifier system of Mandarin Chinese, a linguistic system based on\ncognitiveprinciples.\n\nC.-R.Huang,K.Ahrens/LanguageSciences25(2003)353–373 355\nThisfindingisrelevantforthefollowingreasons:first,itchallengesthetraditional\ntreatment ofindividualasoneofthebasicsemanticconcepts.Inotherwords,when\nindividuals,kindsandeventssharethesameleveloflinguistic/cognitivetaxonomy,a\ntreatment that puts one of them (individuals) as basic and the others derived needs\nto be re-examined. Second, this classification allows a fresh look at the complex\nsemantic concepts of nouns, and at the interaction and coercion that takes place\nbetween classifiers and nouns. Third, it explains why the kind reading in Mandarin\nChinese occurs with a subset of classifiers in addition to its function as a generic\nreading typical of bare nominals.1 Lastly, for each noun type (i.e. individual, kind\nand event nouns) the corresponding classifier type creates a taxonomic system. The\nfact that the more abstract noun types (i.e. events and kinds) can be classified by a\ngrammaticalized system offers the strongest empirical support for their conceptual\nfelicity, since it is the first time that previously abstract semantic distinctions\nbetween kinds, individuals and events is found to be instantiated as a particular\nsystem of a natural language grammar. It isimportant to note that it is well known\nthatlinguisticdevicescanbe used to mark the distinctions of individual, kind, and\nevent. However, there are two crucial differences between these cases and the\nChinese classifier system that we are discussing now. First, previous cases all\ninvolve grammatical devices that are independently motivated and are taken from\nseparate grammatical levels or systems, while the classifier system we discuss here is\na single integral grammatical system. Second, previous cases involve representa-\ntional clues that typically, but not always, mark the semantic distinction, while the\nChinese classifier system entails the exact grammatical function to categorize these\nsemantic distinctions. In other words, there are two possible levels of grammatica-\nlization. A distinction is grammaticalized if the contrasting elements can be dis-\ntinguished by some representational clues. However, a system of categorization is\ngrammaticalized only when the whole system is given corresponding grammatical\nrepresentations.2\nThis paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we distinguish classifiers from\nmeasure words in Mandarin Chinese and we give an overview of the data on which\nour study was based. In the third section, we present evidence for the individual\nreadings of nouns and demonstrate that nouns can occur with more than one indi-\nvidual classifier, and that these occurrences coerce different meanings from the\nnoun. In the fourth section, we discuss the kind readings of classifiers and demon-\nstrate that kind classifiers select a particular class of nouns. In the fifth section, we\ndemonstrate that the Mandarin classifier system also contains classifiers that can\ncoerce an event reading from a nominal. In the last section, we summarize our\nfindings, giving examples of nouns that can be coerced to all three readings, indivi-\ndual, kindand event, and suggest future areas forstudy.\n1 Notethatinthispaper,thetermkindlooselyfollowsCarlson’s(1977)definition.Inthisreading,kind\nreferstoa(contextuallyrelevant)subsetofindividualstowhichthenounapplies.Forinstance,thesen-\ntenceCatsaresmarterthandogsgetstranslatedintothereadingofThecatkindissmarterthanthedog\nkind.ThisreadingcannotberefutedbyanindividualcaseofacertaindoghavinghigherIQthanacertain\ncat.SeediscussionofthekindreadinginMandarinChineseinHuang(1987).\n2 Thankstoareviewerforpointingthisout.\n\n356 C.-R.Huang,K.Ahrens/LanguageSciences25(2003)353–373\n2. Background\nIn the following section we define classifiers as contrasted with measure words,\nand we discuss thescope and source ofclassifiers used in our study.\n2.1. Classifiers and measure words\nTwotraditionsofstudyofclassifiersexistinMandarinChinese.Theclassicalview\ndoes not differentiate measure words from classifiers. For example, Chao (1968:\n584–620) refers to classifiers as individual measures, and subsumes them under the\nrubric of ‘‘measure words’’. Li and Thompson (1981: 106) state that ‘‘any measure\nword canbe a classifier’’.\nHowever, another tradition is based on the premise that measure words are dis-\ntinguishable from classifiers on the basis of a simple syntactic test (Kuo, 1998; Tai\nand Chao, 1994): Can the genitive de particle be inserted between the classifier/\nmeasurewordanditsnoun?In(1)below,decannotbeinserted,sobenisaclassifier.\nBut in (2),de can be inserted, thus kuai isa measureword.\n(1a) yi ben shu\none CL book\n‘one book’\n(1b) *yi ben de shu\none CL GEN book\n‘one book’\n(2a) yi kuai rou\none piece meat\n‘a piece of meat’\n(2b) yi kuaide rou\none piece GEN meat\n‘a piece of meat’\nTai(1990) points outthatthere isalsoan important semanticdistinction between\nthe two notions in that classifiers can only classify over a limited and specific group\nofnouns,whilemeasurewordscanbeusedasameasureforawidevarietyofnouns.\nHis definition isas follows:\nA classifier categorizes a class of nouns by picking out some salient perceptual\nproperties, whether physically or functionally based, which are permanently\nassociated with the entities named by the class of nouns; a measure word\ndoes not categorize but denotes the quantity of the entity named by a noun.\n(1990: 312).\n\nC.-R.Huang,K.Ahrens/LanguageSciences25(2003)353–373 357\nFor example, in (2b) above, ‘kuai’ is a measure word because it does not pick out\nany salient properties of ‘meat’ nor does it categorize a particular type of meat.\n‘Ben’, on the other hand, picks out the salient properties of ‘book’ (i.e. a bound\nvolume with content).\nUnderlyingtheconceptthataclassifiercategorizesoveraclassofnounsbasedon\npermanent perceptual properties is the idea that the basic semantic function of\nnouns is to refer to classic individuals. And although it is a main function of classi-\nfiers in Mandarin to select individuals, in what follows we will show that it is\ninadequate to only view nouns as referring to classic individuals, and that instead\nnouns can be coerced by different types of classifiers to refer to kinds and events as\nwellastoindividuals.Beforewediscusscoerciontokindandeventtypes(Sections4\nand 5), however, we will first explore coercion within the individual reading to\ndemonstratehowdifferentclassifierscanemphasizedifferentsalientpropertiesofthe\nsame noun (Section3).\nIn this study, while acknowledging the conceptual validity of the classifier/\nmeasure dichotomy, our emphasis in on how the ‘classifier’ system correlates with\nthe semantic properties of a noun. In other words, we follow Lyons (1995) and\nsimply treat ‘mensural classfiers’ as a sub-category of classifiers. Hence, there is no\nneed to make any apriori cutoff between the two possiblesub-categories.\n2.2. Sourceandscope ofdata\nOur data are based on the Mandarin Chinese Classifier Dictionary (Chang et al.,\n1994; Huang et al., 1995b). The dictionary itself was compiled based on data from\nthe Academia Sinica Balanced Corpus of Modern Mandarin Chinese (abbreviated\nas Sinica Corpus hereafter). The Sinica corpus is a grammatically tagged and\nbalancedcorpuscontainingatotaloffivemillionwords(CKIP,1995).Itreflectsthe\nMandarin Chinesespoken inTaiwan.\nThe dictionary contains definitions and examples of 427 classifier and measure\nwords. One hundred twenty of these are found in elementary school textbooks and\nthe other 307were selected based on their high frequency in theSinicaCorpus. The\ndictionary also has a second part that lists 1910 noun ending morphemes (and\ntheir associated 12,352 nouns) and lists the classifiers that can co-occur with these\nmorphemes.\nInthedictionary,theclassifiers andmeasurewordsareclassified intoseventypes.\n(The dictionary uses the term liang4ci2 to refer to both classifiers and measure\nwords.) The first three types correspond to our definition of classifier based on the\nsyntactic and semantic definitions given in the previous section and that latter four\ntypescorrespondtomeasurewords.Theseventypesare(1)generalclassifiers(what\nwecallindividualclassifiers),(2)eventclassifiers,(3)kindclassifiers,(4)proximation\nmeasure words, (5) container measure words, (6) standard measure words and (7)\nactivity measure words. There are 174 general classifiers listed in the dictionary, as\nwell as 35 event classifiers and 14 kind classifiers. In the following section we will\nlookathowthegeneralclassifierscancoerceaparticularsemanticreadingbasedon\ntheir semanticproperties.\n\n358 C.-R.Huang,K.Ahrens/LanguageSciences25(2003)353–373\n3. The individual reading\nThe individual reading is the most common aspect of classifier usage. Previous\nwork (Tai and Chao, 1994; Ahrens, 1994) has emphasized that the classifier picks\nout salient features of the noun. Thus each noun will have associated classifier(s),\nthatarelearnedalongwiththatnoun.Forexample,in(3)theclassifiertiaoclassifies\nforlong,cylindrical, flexible objects(Taiand Wang,1990).\n(3a) yi tiao shenzi\none CL rope\n‘rope’\n(3b) yi tiao she\none CL snake\n‘snake’\n(3c) yi tiao yu\none CL fish\n‘fish’\n(3d) yi tiao shayu\none CL shark\n‘shark’\nTai argues that properties entailed in the classifiers can be deduced from examin-\ning the perceptual similarities among nouns that they occur with. For example, in\nadditiontotheanalysisgiveninTaiandWang(1990)fortiao,TaiandChao(1994)\nproposes that zhang classifies over flat, rectangular, two-dimensional, horizontal\nobjects(i.e. it classifies forpaper, tables,chairs etc.).\nInadditiontooccurringwithclassifiersthatcontainspecificperceptualproperties,\nnounscan,inaddition,occurwiththeclassifierge.Thisclassifierhasbeenviewedas\na neutral classifier, because it can occur with nouns of many different semantic\nclasses. Meyers (2000) argues that ge is more correctly viewed as a semantically\nvacuous morpheme that is inserted by a default rule, as opposed to being linked\nwith nouns through analogy as other classifiers are. This may be the case; how-\never, Ahrens (1994) demonstrates that the critical point is that the occurrence of\nge (whether by a default rule or by analogy) does not apply uniformly across\nnouns.\nHerproductionexperimentswithnativespeakersdemonstratethatiftheclassifier\nhas a unique and elaborative relationship (cf. Langacker, 1987) with its noun, it is\nless likely to occur with the neutral classifier ge. On the other hand, the less unique\nandelaborativetherelationship,themorelikelytheneutralclassifiergewilloccurin\nplace ofthemore specific individualclassifier. For example,inanexperiment where\nsubjects were asked to describe the pictures they saw, tiao occurs with shenzi ‘rope’\n\nC.-R.Huang,K.Ahrens/LanguageSciences25(2003)353–373 359\n83%ofthetime,butoccursonly47%ofthetimewithshe‘snake’,only23%oftime\nwith ‘fish’ and only 16% of thetimewith ‘shark’.\nAhrens attributes these results to the fact that although ‘snake’ embodies the\nqualities of ‘thin, cylindrical and flexible’, and therefore has an elaborative rela-\ntionship with its classifier, the animal classifier zhi is competing for occurrence with\nthisnoun,andsoitdoesnotinvolveauniquerelationshipwiththenoun.‘Fish’not\nonly has the animal classifier competing to occur with the classifier zhi, it also does\nnot necessarily entail the quality of cylindricality. ‘Shark’ has an animal classifier\ncompetingwithtiaoandinaddition,doesnotembody‘thinness’nor‘cylindricality’.\nThus, although the system of individual classifiers is based on cognitive principles,\nthe occurrence of a noun with a particular classifier is dependent upon the unique-\nness of the relationship with the noun as well as the possibility of other competing\nclassifiers.\nThis possibility of other competing classifiers is what we will turn to next. In\naddition to individual nouns occurring with the semantically neutral ge, nouns can\nalsooccurwithdifferentspecificclassifiers,althoughthisfacthasnotbeenexamined\nclosely in the previous literature. For example, in (4) the use of the classifier ben is\nthe usual specific classifier used forbooks.Thereis acontrast, however, inmeaning\nbetween (4a) and (4b).\n(4a) Zhangsan mai le san ben shu/bijiben\nZhangsan buy ASP three CL_IN book/notebook\n‘‘Zhangsan boughtthree books/notebooks.’’\n(4b) Zhangsan mai le san bu shu/*bijiben\nZhangsan buy ASP three CL_IN book/notebook\n‘‘Zhangsan boughtthree (different) books/*notebooks.’’\nBenreferstoindividualbooks,whilebureferstobothindividualbooksaswellasto\nthecontentoftheindividualbooks.Thus,inthecaseof(4a)thethreebooksmay(or\nmay not) be three copies of ‘‘War and Peace’’, or they may be notebooks when\nbijiben ‘notebook’ is used. However, in the case of (4b) it is that the three books\nmust all differ in terms of their content, as seen from the fact that the classifier bu\ncannot occur with bijiben ‘notebook’ because notebooks do not necessarily involve\ncontent.\nAnother interesting example of individual classifiers creating a semantic type\nshifting isgiven in(5).\n(5a) bangongshi li you san ju dianhua\noffice IN hasthree CLS_IN telephone\n‘‘There arethree telephone sets in theoffice. [i.e. three pieces of machinery]’’\n(5b) bangongshi li you san xian dianhua\noffice IN has three CLS_IN telephone\n‘‘Therearethreetelephonelinesintheoffice.[i.e.threetelephonenumbers]’’\n\n360 C.-R.Huang,K.Ahrens/LanguageSciences25(2003)353–373\nBothju4andxian4areindividualclassifiers.However,juselectsmachinerywhilexian4\nselectsaline-likeobject,includingthemoreabstractmeaningoflinesofcommunication.\nThe selection of a noun by a classifier is limited however. ‘‘Book,’’ for example,\ncannot occur with the animal classifier zhi to refer to, for example, books about\nanimals, or a child’s book in the shape of an animal. The classifier must select a\nproperty of the entire class of nouns, and not just a particular noun. Thus, all tele-\nphones have a physical receiver as well as a phone line. All books have a physical\nmanifestation of paper (or what appears to be paper in a computer) and have con-\ntent,whilenotebooksonlynecessarilyhavetheformer.Itistheclassifierthatselects\nthe relevant properties of thenoun and coerces the appropriatemeaning.\nPustejovsky (1995) proposes the concept of qualia structure to encode a ‘‘set of\nsemantic constraints by which we understand a word when embedded within the\nlanguage’’(p.86).TheseconstraintsmaybeConstitutive,Formal,Telic,orAgentive\nandaredefinedasfollows:Constitutiveconstraintsinvolvetherelationshipbetween\nan object and its parts and include material, weight and components. Formal con-\nstraints distinguish the object within a larger domain and involve orientation, mag-\nnitude, shape, dimensionality, color and position. Telic constraints involve the\npurpose and function of the object, and Agentive constraints are ‘‘the factors\ninvolved in the origin of an object’’ (Pustejovsky 1995: 86). For instance, book is\nConstitutively defined to contain information; it is Formally defined to be made of\nbound sheets of paper; its Telic constraint defines its typical purpose as being read;\nand finally,its Agentiveconstraint states that it iscreated by writing.\nThus we can see that with the noun dianhua ‘telephone’, the classifier ju4 in (5a)\nhas the Formal role of telephone as an object while the classifier xian in (5b) repre-\nsentstheTelicroleoftelephoneasatooltoconnecttotelephonelines.Inthecaseof\nshu ‘book’, the classifier ben has the Formal role of a bound volume while the clas-\nsifier buinvolvestheConstitutive role ofcompleteand structured knowledge. Thus,\nindividual classifiers can coerce nominal semantic types, and semantic coercion can\nbe predicted through awellencoded qualia structure.\nIn terms of the representation of meaning, Pustejovsky (1995) implies that the\ncomplete qualia structure represents a single nominal sense that facilitates genera-\ntion of different interpretations. In our theory (Ahrens et al., 1998), we make the\ncrucial distinction of allowing a sense to be instantiated as different meaning facets.\nThese different meaning facets (of the same sense) can be derived either by Puste-\njovsky’s type-shifting rules or Allen’s (1977) pragmatic rules. Following our earlier\nattempt to define the unit of sense, our focus of the current study is on how these\ndisparate semantic objects can be coherently represented as a sense. We assume\nwithout further elaboration that when different semantic types (such as individuals,\nsetsofindividuals,properties,setsofproperties,etc.)areinvolved,aChierchiaetal.\n(1989) style type-shifting rule will apply. However, with or without type-shifting,\ncontextual information will ‘coerce’ a sense by eliminating other possible inter-\npretationsinarichlyencodedbutunder-specifiedlexicon.Hence,whatisimportant\ntousisthefactthat,veryoften,thesemanticshiftingisapplicabletoanentireclass\nof nouns (Ahrens et al., 1998). For example, the classifier duo refers to ‘bud’ of a\nplant or flower, while zhu refersto theplantitself,as in(6).\n\nC.-R.Huang,K.Ahrens/LanguageSciences25(2003)353–373 361\n(6a) yi duo hua\none CL flower/plant\n‘one flower’\n(6b) yi zhu hua\none CL flower/plant\n‘one plant’\nThis same shifting in instantiated meaning is applicable to all nouns that end in the\nmorpheme hua ‘flower’, such as meiguihua ‘rose’ or meihua ‘plum flower’, etc. In\nthese cases, it is differences in the Formal properties of the noun that are being\ndistinguished.\nWehavedemonstratedabovethatclassifierscancoercenounstohaveaparticular\nindividual reading depending on the information entailed in the classifier itself. The\nclassifiercanvaryintheConstitutive,Formal,TelicorAgentiverolesthatitcarries.\nThe classifier then forces the noun to undergo a semantic type-shifting, so that the\nsalient properties that the classifier entails are then viewed as the salient properties\nof that noun (even if they weren’t viewed as salient previously).\nIn what follows we will show that this semantic type-shifting is not limited to the\nindividual reading of nouns. Classifiers can also type-shift nouns to a kind reading\nand to an event reading.\n4. The kind reading\n4.1. Kindclassifiers and theirsemantics\nAkindclassifierexplicitlymarksthatthenominalelementthatitselectsandgives\nit a kind reading,as in(7).3\n(7) Nei zhong gou hen huai\nthat CLS_KND dog very bad\n‘‘That kind ofdog is bad.’’\nIftherewasonlyonekindclassifier,thenonecouldarguethatthenotionofkind,\nlike shape or dimension, is just one of the salient perceptual concepts utilized in the\nclassifiersystemofthelanguage.Inthisscenario,thekindreadingwouldbejustone\n3 Downing(1996)doesrefertokind-classifiersandquality-classifiersinherstudyoftheJapaneseclas-\nsifiersystem.However,sheusesthetermtorefertoclassifiersthatpickoutnaturalkinds,whichareoften\nalreadypresentinnounclasses.Inherstudy,thecrucialdistinctioniswhetheracategoryisinductivelyor\ndeductivelydefined.Inotherwords,Downing’skind-classifiersactuallypickoutacategory‘givenbythe\nworld’. This is very different from our kind classifiers that categorizes different kinds and coerce kind\nreadingsfromthenoun.Herkind-classifierswouldsimplybeasubsetofourindividualclassifiers.\n\n362 C.-R.Huang,K.Ahrens/LanguageSciences25(2003)353–373\nTable1\nKindclassifiers\nof the nominal semantic features picked by the classifier. In fact, we will show that\nthere is a whole set of different kind classifiers selecting different semantic kinds. In\nother words, this is a case where a sub-system of classifiers is devoted to the classi-\nfication of the concept of kinds. This fact suggests that kind is treated as a primary\nsemantic type that is ascribed to nominals and allows sub-typing selection by clas-\nsifiers. Thus the Mandarin classifier system will offer the first known evidence that\nthe semantic notion ofkind is grammaticalized in alanguage.\nInadditiontothemostlycommonlyusedzhong3,13additionalkindclassifiersare\nlisted inTable1.\nAll these kind classifiers have the following common grammatical characteristic:\nthey select a broad class of nouns, unlike the highly idiosyncratic selection of the\nindividualclassifiers.Semantically,thisfollowsfromthefactthatkindclassifiersselect\nthekindsrepresentedbynouns,nottheindividualsreferredbythem.Hence,thenat-\nuralkinddelimitedbyacertainnounclassisselectedbytheappropriatekindclassifier.\nThuslei4selectsthekindsdefinedbypropertiesoverconcreteobjects;lei4canalsorefer\ntoakinddefinedbyacollectionofsmallerkindsasin(8).In(9),yang4selectsthekinds\ndefinedbyshapeand appearance.Shi4in(10)issimilartoyang4withanemphasison\nappearance;however,inthiscasetheappearancemustbeanartificialstyling.Kuan3in\n(11)selectsthekindsdefinedbyintensivedesign;andlastly,ma3in(12)anddang3in\n(13)selectkindsofevents.This leaves zhong3 as theneutralkindclassifier,notunlike\n\nC.-R.Huang,K.Ahrens/LanguageSciences25(2003)353–373 363\ntheneutral(ordefault)individualclassifierge,butevenmoreprominentlysosinceitco-\noccurswithvirtuallyallnouns,concreteorabstract.\n(8) zhei san lei shiwu dou shi richang bixu de\nthis three CLS_KDfood all be daily required DE\n‘‘All these three types of food aredaily requirements.’’\n(9) ta daile san yang shuiguo lai kan ni\ns/he bring-PERF three CLS_KD fruit comesee you\n‘‘S/He broughtthree kinds offruitwhen she came to seeyou.’’\n(10) canzhuo shang baiman ge shi caiyao\ndining-table on place full every CLS_KD dish\n‘‘The dining table isfull of all different kinds ofdishes.’’\n(11) fengtianjinnian tuichule liang kuan xinche\nToyotathis-year push-out-PERF two CLS_KD new-car\n‘‘Toyota has brought out two lines ofnewcars this year.’’\n(12) xunlian he bisai wanquanshiliang ma(zi) shi\ntrainingand competition total be two CLS_KD matter\n‘‘Training andactually playing are two totally different matters.’’\n(13) qiuxue he jiaoxue wanquan shi liang dang(zi)shi\nstudying and teaching totally is two CLS_KD matter\n‘‘Studyingand teachingare two totally different things.’’\nThekindclassifiersintheabovesixinstancescanbereplacedbytheneutralclassifier\nzhong3, but not by the neutral individual classifier ge. This further supports the\nposition that kind classifiers form a semantically motivated grammatical class by\nthemselves and are different from individual classifiers. Moreover, like other\nMandarinclassifiers, theinstancesofkindclassifiersthatwe givein(8)–(13)involve\nthe numeral-classifier construction, which shows that kinds are individuated and\nenumerated.\n4.2. The bareNP reading\nBare NPs in Mandarin Chinese have a wide range of possible interpretations.\nAmong these interpretations thekind reading isone ofthe most difficult toaccount\nfor(see example14 below).\n(14) gou bi mao da\ndog compare cat big\n‘‘Dogsare bigger than cats. [preferred reading]’’\nOR ‘‘This dog isbigger than this cat.’’\n\n364 C.-R.Huang,K.Ahrens/LanguageSciences25(2003)353–373\nWith the kind reading exemplified in (14), the NPs do not refer to any specific indi-\nvidual, nor do they refer to all instances in within the species. Hence (14) does not\nlogically entail that a specific dog is bigger than a specific cat, contrary to the pre-\ndiction of an account where the bare NP refers to either an individual animal or\nsome subset of the animals. What is interesting is the additional reading. It says a\nspecific dog is bigger than a specific cat. This is an impossible interpretation for the\n(English) generic reading. However, if we take the kind reading in Chinese as pick-\ning up the contextually defined subset of individual(s) to which the noun applies,\nthenitispossibletoseecontextswhereexactlyoneindividualwillbepicked.Hence\nthe individualreading can be uniformly accountedfor (Huang,1987).\nThe same semantic effect is achieved when the kind interpretation is marked by a\nclassifier. Although the kind reading is previously thought to be one of the generic\nreadings typical of bare nominals (Carlson, 1977; Chierchia, 1982), this reading can\nalso occurwiththe kind classifier in Mandarin asshownin (15).\n(15) zhe zhong ma zaihuabei hen changjian\nthis CLS_KD horse atChina-north verycommon-seen\n‘‘Thiskind of horse isvery commonly seenin Northern China.’’\n(Huang, 1987).\nThe sentence in example (15) does not entail that any specific individual horse of\nthe referred kind is in north China, nor does it entail that a majority of this kind of\nhorse is there. Its interpretation is that a contextually defined subset of this parti-\ncular kind of horses is commonly seen in north China. In addition, this data casts\ndoubt on a structural account, such as in the Government and Binding framework\n(e.g. Tang, 1990), where classifiers are assigned to the Specifier position; since whe-\nther the Specifier position is lexically filled or not can no longer be a test of the\nspecificity/definiteness ofthe NP.4\nThe fact that (16) below serves as a paraphrase of (14) also supports our obser-\nvation that the existence of classifiers such as zhong3 achieve the same semantic\neffect ofkindreading.\n(16) zhez hong dongwubi naz hong dongwuda\nthis CLS_KDanimal COMP that CLS_KD animal big\n‘‘Thiskind of animalisbigger than that kind of animal.’’\nThe free variation of Mandarin bare nominals between kind and individual read-\nings is accounted for with type-shifting (Huang, 1987; Chierchia et al., 1989). It is\n4 The relationship between the classifier and the specific interpretation is language-dependent. For\nexample,inCantoneseaclassifierisnecessarybutnotsufficientforaspecificinterpretation.However,in\nMandarinChineseaclassifierisneithernecessarynorsufficienttoimplyaspecificinterpretation(Mat-\nthewsandPacioni,1997).\n\nC.-R.Huang,K.Ahrens/LanguageSciences25(2003)353–373 365\ninteresting to observe, however, that the use of the classifier zhong3 in (15) and (16)\nentails that there is obligatory type-shifting and the sentence is unambiguously\ninterpreted as a kind reading.\nIn sum, we have shown in this section that kind classifiers form an integral class\nwithin the Mandarin classifier system. They individuate and classify the different\nkind readings that can be obtained from nominal semantics. Thus we have shown\nthat the notion of kind is not only crucial to theories of nominal semantics, but is\nalso attested by the grammatical system ofa natural language.\n5. The event reading\nIn this section we will show that the Mandarin classifier system contains a sub-\nclass that selects another theoretically significant entity: i.e. event-type entities.\nChierchia (1982) was one of the first semanticists to propose that events and activ-\nities could be referred to as entities. He studied nominalization and the English\ngerund system and demonstrated that the grammatical system marks the type-\nshifting from events to event-type entities (i.e. names of the events.) In (17), that\nthe gerund ‘‘seeing’’ refers to a certain type of event as is obvious from its verbal\nderivation.\n(17) Seeing isbelieving.\nThusthesemanticsofnominalizationistreatedbyChierchiaasaninstanceoftype-\nshifting which individuates the events. In Mandarin, however, not only is no\nmorpho-lexical marking involved when the event-type nominal is deverbal, it is\nalso possible to coerce an event type reading from a noun without any deriva-\ntion. We will show in this section that the event classifiers coerce just such an\neffect. Since there will be no marking on the nouns, it is necessary to develop tests\nfor event-type entities to prove that the classifier-noun phrase does have an event\nreading.\nIt should be noted that event-type nominals have eventive semantics, including\nevent structures. The semantic (not syntactic) nature of events is that they are tem-\nporally anchored, and that they take arguments. Thus, the semantic tests we have\nfor event-type nominals are that they occur as temporal delimiters, and that they\nallow oblique arguments. Two additional syntactic tests are that they satisfy the\nsubcategorization requirement of predicates which take event-type arguments, and\nthat they cannotbe replaced by theneutral individualclassifier ge.\nFirst,anevent cannottakeplacewithoutatimeframe,eitheratemporalpointof\nitsoccurrenceora(relative)timedurationofitsexistence.Thus,temporalreference\nis an integral part of the semantics of events, including event-type nominals. The\nindividual classifiers, on the other hand, do not carry temporal reference in their\nsemantics. Thus, an important grammatical characteristic of event-type nominals is\nthat they co-occur with a temporal subordinator, such as yi3hou4 ‘after’ (without\nany predicates) to establish the temporal (and causal) sequence of events; (18a)\n\n366 C.-R.Huang,K.Ahrens/LanguageSciences25(2003)353–373\nshows how such a temporal sequence is established with a full clause. In (18b) we\nshow that when the classifier tang4 is used, the noun taijiquan ‘‘TaiChi boxing’ can\nrefer to theeventwithoutany overt verbal predicate.\n(18a) dale taijiquan yihouta shenti shufu duo le\nplayLE Tai_Chi after s/he body comfortable more LE\n‘‘S/he feels much betterafterdoingTai Chi.’’\n(18b) san tang taijiquan yihou ta shenti shufu duo le\nthree CLS_EV Tai-Chi after s/he body comfortable more PERF\n‘‘S/he feels much betterafter(performing)three rounds of TaiChi.’’\nSecond, it is well-known that event-type nominals preserve their argument\nstructure and take (oblique) arguments, such as the English possessive ‘‘John’s pro-\nmotion’’ or ‘‘Mary’s leaving early’’. In Mandarin, a deverbal noun can take a pos-\nsessive (encliticized with de), or preceding oblique arguments, such as the underlined\nNP in (19).\n(19) Zhangsan dui Lisi de jianyi\nZhangsan TO Lisi DE suggestion\n‘‘Zhangsan’s suggestion/advice forLisi (i.e. Zhangsan advised Lisi)’’\nIn (20), we show that when an event classifier is used, the nominal head takes an\nevent reading and thepossessor isinterpreted as an argument ofthe head.\n(20) zhongtong de yitong dianhua\npresident DE oneCLS_EVtelephone\n‘‘A call from the President (i.e. the President madethe phone call)’’\nLast,itcanbeshowninMandarinthattheeventreadingisselectedbyafewsmall\nclasses of verbs, such as light verbs jin4xing2 ‘‘to proceed’’ (Huang et al., 1995a,b),\nhappenstance verbs fa1sheng1 ‘‘to happen’’, and event-evaluation verbs hua1 ‘‘to\ncost’’.

Thus, it supports our position that event classifiers selects event-\ntype nominals.\n(22) zhechang dianyingbu hua qian\nthisCLS_EV movie NEG cost money\n‘‘It did notcostany money to seethis movie.’’\nInaddition,example(23)alsoshowsthattheeventreadingcanbecoercedfroma\nbare NP, similarly toexample (21a).\n(23) dianying hen hua qian\nmovie verycostmoney\n‘‘It isvery expensive (to make/finance/watch/...) movies’’\nHowever, when a bare NP is type-shifted to an eventive reading, the actual event is\nunderspecified and may have a wide range of interpretations whereas in (22), we\nshowedthatwhentheeventmeaningiscoercedbyaclassifier,italsodeterminesthe\nevent-type. In other words, the semantic coercion fits the classical description of\nwhat aclassifier does.

Eventclassifiers and their semantics\nPustejovsky’s (1995) theory of a Generative Lexicon proposes that the semantics\nof nouns cannot be completely represented without referring to two different event-\nstructuresencodedinthequaliastructureofeachlexicalentry.TheAgentiveroleof\na noun is defined in terms of an event structure describing how this noun ‘‘origi-\nnated’’. The Telic role is defined in terms of an event structure describing the func-\ntion of the noun. His point is that polysemy cannot be accounted for if these two\naspectsof a noun are not considered.\nAdopting Pustejovsky’s position, the fact that certain classifiers can coerce event\nreadings from nouns that are typically interpreted as individuals is not surprising,\nsince their semantic representation already contains event structure information.\nSince these event structures are idiosyncratically encoded, we also correctly predict\nthat the selection between event classifiers and their nominal heads are more\nrestrictive than kind classifiers. We will further classify the event classifiers into the\nevent-type classifiers, which individuate different event structures, and the event-\ntoken classifiers, which individuateeach occurrence of an event.\n\n368 C.-R.Huang,K.Ahrens/LanguageSciences25(2003)353–373\nTable2\nEventclassifiers\nHuangetal.(1995a,b)list35classifiersaseventclassifiers.TheyarelistedinTable2.\nAmong these event classifiers, the event-type classifiers are more specialized since\ntheyselectaparticulareventtype. For instance, the event-type classifier chu1 selects\nthe nouns which contains the stems of either ju2 ‘‘drama’’ in (24a) or xi4 ‘‘play’’ in\n(24b).\n\nC.-R.Huang,K.Ahrens/LanguageSciences25(2003)353–373 369\n(24a) shashibiya daodi yigong xiele ji chu xi?\nShakespeare eventuallytogether write-PREF how_many CLS_EV play\n‘‘Howmany plays did Shakespeare write all together?’’\n(24b) bailaohui jin nian zhi yan le yi chu gewuju\nBroadway this yearonly play PERF one CLS_EV musical\n‘‘Onlyonemusical(e.g.Cats)wasperformedonBroadwayallyearthisyear.’’\nThe two sentences above have Agentive (24a) and Telic (24b) readings respectively,\nsuggesting that these event readings are coerced from the Pustejovskian qualia\nstructure.TheAgentivereadingof(24a)specificallyreferstotheeventtypesofhow\na play comes into being. The Telic reading of (24b) refers specifically to the event\ntypes of why a play is produced (to be viewed). They also clearly show that chu1\nindividuates event-types.\nIncontrast,when anevent-tokenclassifier isused, thesamenoun willrefertothe\noccurrences of the event.

We also have shown that the semantics of event classifiers can be further\ndistinguished as referring toeither theeventtype oreventtokens.\n6. Conclusion\nWe have demonstrated above that it is inadequate to view the ontology of the\nclassifier system asbasedontheclassicnotion ofindividuals.Weargueinsteadthat\nthetopleveloftheontologyoftheMandarinChineseclassifiersystemisactuallytri-\npartite: individual, kind, and event. An important motivation in studying this new\nontology of the Mandarin Chinese classifier system is the fact that even seemingly\nstraightforward referential nominals have complex semantic content, as suggested\nby our data as well as recent studies on nominal lexical semantics which refer to\ndifferent individual or events (Pustejovsky, 1993, 1995). In fact, the semantics of\nnouns are more complicated than one might suspect. As we have shown above,\nMandarin Chinese offers one of the most dramatic illustrations since its nouns can\nhave very different meanings without any additional morphological markings. Our\nmain generalization is summarized below. Three of the possible meanings of the\nnoundian4hua4‘‘telephone’’andoffei1ji1‘‘airplane’’canbebroughtoutbytheuse\nof different classifiers, asgivenin Tables 3and 4respectively.\nTheindividualclassifiers juandxiancanselect oneoftwointerpretationsrelating\nto the ‘phone’. The former selects the telephone machinery itself, while the latter\nselectsthelineforthephone,asin‘lineone’or‘linetwo’.Thekindclassifiercoerces\na kind reading so that a particular type of phone (i.e. cordless or cell phone) is\nreferred to. The event classifier coerces an eventive reading and refers to the com-\npleted actof calling.\nTable3\nClassifierandnominalsemantictypecorrelationfordianhua‘‘telephone’’\nSemantic/Classifiertype Example Reference\nIndividual yi ju dian-hua Telephone\noneCLS_INtelephone Machinery\n‘‘onetelephone’’\nyi xian dian-hua\noneCLS_INtelephone Telephoneline\n‘‘onetelephoneline’’\nKind yi zhong dian-hua Aparticularkindofphone,\noneCLS_KDtelephone e.g.cordless\n‘‘onekindoftelephone’’\nEvent yi tong dian-hua Thecompletedeventofcalling\noneCLS_EVtelephone\n‘‘onephonecall’’\n\nC.-R.Huang,K.Ahrens/LanguageSciences25(2003)353–373 371\nTable4\nClassifierandnominalsemantictypecorrelationforfeiji‘‘airplane’’\nSemantic/ClassifierType Example Reference\nIndividual yi jia feiji Airplane\noneCLS_INairplane\n‘‘oneairplane’’\nKind yi zhong feiji Aparticularkindofairplane,e.g.jet\noneCLS_KDairplane\n‘‘onekindofairplane’’\nEvent yi ban feiji Thecompletedeventofflying\noneCLS_EVairplane\n‘‘onescheduledflight’’\nInTable4,jiaistheindividualclassifier thatisusedtorefer tothephysicalentity\nofanairplane,whilezhongisusedtorefertoaparticularkindofairplane.Banisan\nevent classifier that coerces the concept of a completed event flying from the noun\n‘airplane.’\nThe implications for this new tripartite classification of classifiers are three-fold:\nfirst, it explains why the kind reading in Mandarin Chinese, while it can be under-\nstood as a generic reading typical of bare nominals, also occurs with a subset of\nclassifiers(i.e.thekindclassifiers)andisasemantictypeinandofitself.Second,the\npreviously abstract semantic distinctions between kinds, individuals and events are\nnowfound tobe instantiatedinoneparticular system (i.e. theclassifier system)ofa\nnaturallanguagegrammar,andmoreover,thesethreeclassifiertypeshavetheirown\ntaxonomic system. Thus, this suggests that the semantic types of individuals, kinds\nand events are useful categorizing tools for humans (and not just formal semanti-\ncists), and that these concepts are encoded on a cognitive level. Finally, this classi-\nfication allows us to a take a fresh look at the complex semantic contents of nouns,\nand at theinteraction and coercion that takes place between classifiers and nouns.\nIn future studies, we hope our findings will help us to better understand the\ninteraction of semantic meanings among kinds, individuals, and generics (Carlson\nandPelletier,1995;Chierchia,1994).Inparticular,basedonthereadyavailabilityof\nthe kind reading, either with bare plurals in all languages or with kind classifiers in\nChinese,wesuspectthatthekindroleshouldbepartofthenominalqualiastructure\nin the theory of a Generative Lexicon. With regard to the event readings of nom-\ninals, even though the present theory of qualia structure does offer an possible\naccountofhowthesereadingscanbeobtainedfromthelexicalsemanticsofthenom-\ninals,morethoroughstudiesareneededinordertoshedlightonwhethertheAgentive\nand Telic events are the only events that are necessarily encoded in the nominal\nsemantics, as well as additional studies on how these event readings are selected.\nLastly, as Alexandra Aikhenvald has pointed out (p.c. August 2001) event-type\nclassifiers in other languages have been described, although the term event may not\n\n372 C.-R.Huang,K.Ahrens/LanguageSciences25(2003)353–373\nhavebeenused[e.g.Aikhenvald’s(2000)discussionofuseofclassifierswithabstract\nnouns (pp. 335–336)]. It would be interesting to examine if these instances do fall\nunderevent-type classifiers as we havedefined them in this paper.\nMoreover, if they do, do these languages also have a kind classifier system (in\nadditionofcoursetoanindividualclassifiersystem)?Thatis,towhatextentarethe\nsemantic concepts of individual, kind and event instantiated in the grammars of\nother language’sclassifiers systems?\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank the National Science Council of the ROC for funding\nNSC 86-2411-H-194-012 and NSC90-2411-H-002-008-MC.
