Ontology in its modern form is the study of how knowledge is organized and\nrepresented in knowledge systems (Prévot et al. 2010). As such, recent studies on\nontology have focused mostly on digital knowledge representation systems, especially\nweb-based systems. Such studies, however, also involves the knowledge systems of\nhuman language and hence lead to crucial research issues in the interface between\nontology and natural language lexicon and in how languages conventionalize know-\nledge representation systems (OntoLex, Huang et al. 2010a).\n©2015Huang;licenseeSpringer.ThisisanopenaccessarticledistributedunderthetermsoftheCreativeCommonsAttribution\nLicense(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0),whichpermitsunrestricteduse,distribution,andreproductioninanymedium,\nprovidedtheoriginalworkisproperlycredited.\n\nHuangLinguaSinica (2015) 1:1 Page2of22\nOne important issue in ontology and OntoLex in particular is whether the onto-\nlogical conceptual primes are also linguistically expressed. The focus of this study\nwill be on one of the most fundamental concepts for the knowledge classification:\nthe endurant/perdurant dichotomy for classification of entities. This concept dichot-\nomizes entities according to whether they are dependent on time or not. To para-\nphrase the position taken in DOLCE ontology (Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic\nand Cognitive Engineering, Gangemi et al. 2010), an endurant, is (the concept of) an\nentity that has spatial components but does not depend on a specific time of occur-\nrence. In other words, it can exist at any point in time and perceived to be identical\nat different temporal locations. A perdurant is (the concept of) an entity which has a\ntime element crucially associated with its meaning. In other words, to define (the\nconcept of) a perdurant, we need to take into consideration the variations of its in-\nstantiation at different time points. Rigid designators such as people and objects are\nthe most typical endurants. For instance, Y. R. Chao in 1955 and in 1968 is the same\nentity in spite of physical changes. Processes and activities are the most typical per-\ndurants. A perdurant, such as the process of writing, exists as the sum of different\nstages at different times. At any snapshot of time, it is possible to find instantiations\nof different aspects of the same process of writing.\nAs Chinese is a language that has been shown to explicitly encode ontology with its\nradical-based writing system (Chou and Huang 2010, Huang et al. 2013b), it is natural\nforustoaskwhethertheendurant/perdurantdichotomyisalsorepresentedinChinese.\nTo answer this question, the classifier system, which marks linguistic classifications\nof objects, should be the first system to be examined. In other words, we will\nbe concerned with the issue of whether the linguistic system of classifiers have\nontological basis. Classifiers are given the grammatical category of Measure (M) in\nDeterminer-Measure Compound (D-M Compound), a grammatical category specific to\nChinese introducedinY.R.Chao’s(1968)Chinesegrammar.AlthoughweadoptChao’s\nterm of D-M, we follow subsequent studies (e.g. T'sou 1976, Mo et al. 1996, among\nothers) in treating D-M as a classifier phrase. It is also important to note that Chao\n(1968) listed 9 different M’s, including those measuring activities in a verbal phrase.\nThecurrentstudyfocusesonnounphraseM’sthathavebeentypicallytreatedinChinese\nlinguistics as part of the linguistic system of classifiers (Aikhenvald 2003). The literature,\nhowever, does vary in how Chao’s M should be further analyzed and whether all sub-\nclasses of M are in fact classifiers. Li and Thompson (1981) uses classifier as a covering\nterm to include measure words; while Tai (1994) stipulate that M contains two distinct\ncategories:classifiersandmeasurewords,andinAReferenceGrammarofChinese(Huang\nand Shi 2016),the classifier categorynameis retainedbut differentiatedintotwo distinct\ncategories: sortal classifiers and measure words (Ahrens and Huang 2016). Many studies\n(e.g.Huangetal.黃居仁等1997,HerandHsieh2010)havetriedtoaccountfortheclas-\nsifiers/measure words contrast via semantic or syntactic tests without reaching a definite\nconclusion.Wiebusch(1995),infact,studiedtheclassificationofChineseclassifiersinre-\nlationtotheradicalsystems,underliningtheconceptualbasisofthelinguisticrepresenta-\ntionofclassificationinChinese.\nThe linguistic expression of the classifier system of Mandarin Chinese has two char-\nacteristics that make it a valued primary source for ontological studies. First, it is\nunique among classifier languages in the world to have classifiers for events and kinds\n\nHuangLinguaSinica (2015) 1:1 Page3of22\nin addition to individual objects (e.g. Huang and Ahrens 2003, Huang et al. 黃居仁等\n1997). This broad conceptual coverage provides a comprehensive coverage for onto-\nlogical studies. Second, it has been shown in cognitive studies that the use of classi-\nfiers is semantically motivated (e.g. Ahrens 1994) and that there is neurological\nevidence for speakers to use classifiers to predict the semantic classes of nouns (e.g.\nChou et al. 2014, Wang and Zhang 2014). Lastly, Huang et al. (1998) demonstrated\nthataChinesenounclasssystemcouldbeautomaticallyextractedbasedonthecollocation\nof noun and classifiers. In sum, Chinese classifier system has both the conceptual\nrobustnessandthecorrespondinglinguisticexpressionsneededtoprovidedirectevidence\nofstudyofasharedknowledgerepresentation.Thispaperadoptsandmergestwolinesof\nChao’s research to show that the ontological concept of endurant vs. perdurant is\nelegantlyinstantiatedinChinesegrammar,andbythecategoryofMinparticular.\nIn what follows, I will first introduce ontology as an emergent discipline studying how\nhumanknowledgesystemisrepresented,aswellasillustratethefundamentaldichotomyof\nendurant/perdurant. This is followed by a brief introduction of recent studies in ontology\nwith Chinese as a target language. I will then recapture the linguistic generalizations of\nMandarinChineseD-Mcompounds.Thisisfollowedbyevidenceandargumentationshow-\ning that D-M compounds is a linguistic system which expresses the endurant/perdurant\ndichotomy.Thepaperconcludeswithasummaryoftheresultsaswellastheirimplications\nfortheontologicalstudiesoflinguisticsystems.\n2 Ontology as knowledge system and the endurant/perdurant dichotomy\n2.1Ontologyandknowledgesystem\nOntology studies the system for knowledge representation in terms of basic concepts\nand how these concepts are organized in terms of relations, especially in the context of\ncomputational representation (Gruber 1995). With the web becoming the primary\nsource for information, which causes both the supplyof information and desire for that\ninformation to increase exponentially, the need to directly process the semantics of\nweb-based content has become urgent (i.e. the semantic turn of the world wide web).\nOntology is the proposed solution to allow computers to process the semantic content\nof a web page by explicitly stipulating the knowledge representation system of that web\nsite(Berners-Leeetal.2001).Giventhateachweb-sitemaypresentdifferentknowledge\nsystems (hence different ontologies), the construction of a common upper ontology\nfor all ontological systems then become a foundational task in the study of ontology\n(e.g. SUMO, Niles and Pease 2001, DOLCE, Gangemi et al. 2003, and BFO, Smith and\nGrenon2004).Andsincehumanbeingsaccessinformationandrepresentknowledgewith\ndifferent languages, the interface between lexica as knowledge representation systems for\nlanguagesandontology(Huangetal.2010a),aswellasamongwebcontent,isrepresented\nin different languages (Builtelaar and Cimiano 2014). The interface between different\ndomains and among different languages is among the most challenging issues linking\nstudiesonlanguageandontology(Bondetal.2014).\n2.2Theendurant/perdurantdichotomyastheprimarybifurcationofentities\nOne of the most fundamental issues in knowledge representation and in providing the-\noreticalfoundation for the construction ofanontologyis thefirstbinary bifurcation for\n\nHuangLinguaSinica (2015) 1:1 Page4of22\nentities (i.e. beings that exist, and not limited to referential objects). This is a seemingly\nsimple decision that will dictate the fundamental design of the knowledge system, that\nis, the underlying conceptual or informational criteria for creating different branches in\nthe knowledge system. Hence, before committing to any structure, builders of upper\nontology (the shared upper parts of ontologies systems) often engage in extensive dis-\ncussion in philosophical, logical, linguistic, and cognitive theories before making com-\nmitment to this bifurcation (e.g. Guarino 1998, and Guarino and Welty 2002 for\nDOLCE, Niles and Pease2001for SUMO, and Grenonand Smith2004for Basis Formal\nOntology (BFO)). Interestingly, many upper ontologies adopt the endurant/perdurant di-\nchotomyforthisprimaryclassification,althoughinsomewhatdifferentways.Thisfunda-\nmental classification of entities roughly corresponds to what is called continuant and\noccurrent inphilosophy (Gangemi et al. 2003, Grenonand Smith 2004).To put it some-\nwhatsimplistically,anendurantisanentitywhichisfullypresentatanytime;whileaper-\ndurant is an entity which may have only parts of it present at any specific time, i.e. its\npresenceascapturedby‘snapshots’atdifferenttimemayvary,anditsexistenceisdefined\nby sum of these ‘snapshots’. Hence the implication is that it is NOT the shape or other\nperceivablephysical properties,but ratherthe entity’scontinuityofexistence intimethat\nplays a central role in the classification of entities in our knowledge systems. Different\nupper ontologies, however, do implement this bifurcation differently. BFO, for instance,\nhasastraightforwardbifurcationofcontinuantvs.occurrent,andallowsqualityandother\nproperties to be subsumed under either type of entities (Grenon and Smith 2004, Smith\nandGrenon2004)a.DOLCE,ontheotherhand,applytheendurant/perdurantdichotomy\nto entities only (Gangemi et al. 2003), and treats Quality as a separate ontological\ncategoryb. The expression of endurant/perdurant dichotomy can be illustrated by the\nDOLCE upper ontology (adapted from Gangemi et al. 2003, Gangemi et al. 2010) and\ngiven Figure 1 below. A different representation is BFO’s basic bifurcation of continu-\nant/occurrent, as illustrated Figure 2 (adapted from Smith 2012).\nFigures 1 and 2 present two alternatives to incorporate the endurant/perdurant di-\nchotomy in ontology. BFO’s view is that these are simply two views to represent our\nknowledge. If we take a three-dimensional view focused on the continuant, we could\ndescribetheindependent (i.e.referential) partofthe continuantas wellas the dependent\npartofthecontinuant(i.e.thedispositionandqualityofthecontinuant).DOLCE,onthe\nother hand, restrict the endurant/perdurant classification for entities only, and identifies\nqualityasa separateuniquebeginninginontology.Anticipatingthatthe classifiersystem\nwill involve quality of the entity, we can also compare these two views to see which is\nbetter suited to describe this linguistic system.\nGiven the prominent role of the time and variation driven endurant vs. perdurant\ndichotomy in ontology, it will be interesting to find out if it is expressed in linguistic\nsystems and how. Intuitively, by the definition of endurant/perdurant and the DOLCE\nontology example, we can see that noun is a part of speech (PoS) which is typically\nadopted for endurants; while verbs are typical PoS’s adopted for perdurants. However,\nthe similarity stops at broad conceptual motivation as most linguistic systems are far\nmore complex. Thelinkis fairly straightforward forproper nounsasrigiddesignators,\nas their references do not change over time. Similarly, the meaning of common nouns,\nsuch as ‘book’ or ‘soldier’, cannot be fully interpreted unless we assume the presence of\nthewholeentityatanytimewheretheexistenceofthatentityisconfirmed.‘Abookwith\n\nHuangLinguaSinica (2015) 1:1 Page5of22\nFigure1DOLCEupperontology:entities.\nit cover missing’ or ‘a soldier who lost an arm during World War II’can be understood\nand the entities can be recognized as ‘the same’as before the loss of their parts because\nthe conceptual whole may be invoked at any time. Verbs, on the other hand, refer to a\nprocessthatiscarriedoutinadynamicwayovertime.Withenoughtemporalgranularity,\none can see that the presence of an event entity must vary from one time point to the\n\nHuangLinguaSinica (2015) 1:1 Page6of22\nFigure2BasicFormalOntology(BFO)upperontology.\nother. ‘To run, running,’for example, can be envisioned as a series of snapshots where a\nfoot is on or off the ground, or on an upward or downward trajectory. It is even more\nobvious for complex events such as accomplishment and achievement that at any\ngiven time, only part of the full event as entity is present. In other words, the endurant/\nperdurantdichotomyseemstoprovide conceptualmotivationbehindthenominal/verbal\ndichotomyadoptedinlinguisticsystems.\nIt is well known, however, that the intuitive nominal/verbal distinction can be easily\nblurredwithmanycategorical changedevicesinlanguageaswellaswithatypicalmem-\nbers of each PoS: such as event nouns, deverbal nominal, denominal verbs etc. Hence\nfor the verby/nouny bifurcation, the endurant/perdurant dichotomy seems to be a de-\nfault motivation rather than a conceptual must and is not systematically expressed.\nHence, we need to look further for clear evidence of if and how a linguistic system,\nsuch asChinese, expressesthe endurant/perdurant dichotomy.\n2.3Chineseasaknowledgesystem:recentstudiesonontologyandChinese\nOntological studies of language and lexicon (e.g. Gangemi et al. 2003, 2010, Pease and\nFellbaum 2010) have focused on the mapping of the linguistic system built on lexical\nsemantic relations (e.g. hypernym) to the ontological system built on logical relations\n(i.e. ISA relation). Although similar studies have been carried out on Chinese (e.g.\nHuang et al. 2010b), the fact that Chinese orthography explicitly designate radicals\nas semantic primitives provides a new perspective on the possible relation between\nlanguage and ontology. It has also previously been demonstrated that Chinese orthog-\nraphy is a conventionalized knowledge representation system (Hantology, Chou and\nHuang 2010). In addition, Huang et al. 黃居仁等 (2013a) and Huang et al. (2013b)\nshowed that the ontological system with radicals representing semantic primitives is\ndriven by Aristotle’s four causes and have the generative power similar to Pustejovs-\nky’s (1995) qualia structure. This is illustrated by Figure 3, adapted from Chou and\nHuang (2010).\nWhatFigure3illustratesisthatalltheChinesecharacterssharingthesameradical艸cao\n‘grass,’ instantiated as the double cross components on top of each character, incorporates\ntheconceptualprimitiveof ‘plant’.Howthisdiffersfromatypicaltaxonomyhastodowith\nthefact that therelation between thesemantic primitiveand derived conceptsis far richer\nthanwhatisusuallyfoundinatypicalIS-Arelation.Forcharacterswiththeradical艸cao\n‘grass,’ the conceptualrelations includeIS-A, IS_Part_Of,Telic,and Event_descriptive.

Huang et al. (2013) takes this argument one step\nfurther when they point out that the Chinese orthography is indeed a knowledge system\norganized by radicals which each represent a conceptual primitive but are organized\naccording to eventive relations similar to the Four Causes or the four qualia. Huang et al.\n(2013b) showed that in fact this analysis can be extended to all radicals in Chinese and\nthat Chinese orthography is indeed a conventionalized knowledge representation\nsystem. This ontological interpretation of the Chinese orthography laid a foundation\nfor accountsof itsconceptual robustness and representational versatilityas the shared\nwriting system through historical changes (Chou and Huang 周亞民, 黃居仁 2006)\nand for typologically divergent languages (Huang and Chou 2015).\n3 Classifiers as an ontological system\n3.1TheChineseclassifiersystem\nM in a D-M compound (including sortal classifiers and measure words) individuates the\nentityrepresentedbyNPtoallowittobequantified.Itdoessobyselectingsomeproper-\nties of that entity as the basis for units of individuation and enumeration Aikhenvald\n(2003).\nIn what follows, I investigate the conceptual basis of the properties selected by M in\norder to attempt to differentiate the type of properties selected by different sub-types\nof M’s in light of the endurant/perdurant dichotomy. In particular, I look at whether M\nselects a time-invariant (endurant) or time-variant (perdurant) property of that entity.\n\nHuangLinguaSinica (2015) 1:1 Page8of22\nThe current study adopts the sub-categories of classifiers (M) given in Ahrens and\nHuang (2016), which largely follow Chao’s (1968) grammar with updates to reflect later\nstudies on Chinese grammar and classifiers. As seen in Figure 4, classifiers (M’s) are di-\nvided into two major categories based on their linguistic behaviors: sortal classifiers\nand measure words. Intuitively, sortal classifiers select the semantic class of their head\nnouns, while measure words do not have strict selectional preferences. Sortal classifiers\nconsist of three sub-categories: individual classifiers, event classifiers and kind classifiers.\nMeasure words also consist of three categories: container measure words, standard\nmeasure words, and temporary measure words.\nNote that even though Iuse constructed examples for clear explication,they are con-\nstructed to be representational of generalizations attested and extracted from the 5\nmillion word version of Sinica Corpus (Chen et al. 1996) and accounted for in Huang\net al. 黃居仁等 (1997). It also important to note individual variation is a hallmark of\nhumanlanguages(Fillmore et al.1979).Hence it isexpectedthat some speakers mayhave\ndifferences in interpreting or usage of some of the examples presented. It is important to\nensure that such variations are not in conflict with the basic expression of the ontological\nbifurcation. In addition, the aim of this paper is not to describe all linguistic variations,\nbut to capture the systemicity of the expression of the ontological notions, as well as the\nrobustnessoftheconceptualmotivationofthelinguisticsystem.\n3.2Sortalclassifiersdenoteendurantproperties\n3.2.1Individualclassifiers\nFirst, as the most typical sortal classifier, individual classifiers typically select common\nnouns, which of course are endurant entities. However, the property the classifier\nselects depends on the meaning referred to. For instance, 張 zhang as an individual\nclassifier has multiple senses, and two of the most frequent senses are exemplified\nby 一張紙 yi zhang zhi ‘a piece of paper’, and 一張椅子 yi zhang yizi ‘a chair’. 張\nFigure4Chineseclassifiersystem(AhrensandHuang2016).\n\nHuangLinguaSinica (2015) 1:1 Page9of22\nzhang in 一張紙 yi zhang zhi ‘a piece of paper’ represent the sheet-like property of\npaper, which is an endurant property of paper (or any other common noun selected\nby 張 zhang). If this type of common noun exists in this form, it cannot lose this\nproperty. Similarly for 一張椅子 yi zhang yizi ‘a chair’, the classifier 張 zhang selects\nthe endurant property of a flat surface where people can put their body on (e.g. beds\nand chairs). Note that this is a telic property defined by the designed purpose, in-\nstead of direct description of physical properties of an object. The fact that the prop-\nerties denoted by these individual classifiers are time-invariant can be shown in real\nworld situations where that property seems to be challenged, as in 1a-b below.\n(1)a. 一張破破爛爛的紙\nyi__zhang__popolanlan__de__zhi\none__CL__tattered__DE__paper\none pieceoftatteredpaper\nb. 那張缺腿的椅子\nna__zhang__quetui__de__yizi\nthat__CL__leg-missing__DE__chair\nthat chair withamissingleg\n1a-b show that the property denoted by individual classifiers endures at all time as long\nasthatentityexists,regardlessoftheactualphysicalstateoftheentity.In1a,aslongasan\nentity’sexistenceaspaperisconfirmed,itslinguisticexpressionwiththe張zhangclassifier\nis notaffectedbyhowtattered and un-sheet-likeitis at acertainspecifictime.Similarfor\nthe furniture with flat surface 張 zhang in 1b, as long as the existence of the entity is\nconfirmed, the classifier can be used to express that enduring property regardless of\nwhethertheobjectiscapableofservingitsfurniturefunctionatthespecifictime.\nThe individual classifier that is most difficult to analyze is perhaps the generic classi-\nfiers 個 ge, as the property it selects is famously difficult to capture precisely. We could\nin general describe the property as ‘individualizable’. I.e. 個 ge typically selects common\nnouns that can be selected by one of the individual classifiers. In this sense, the classi-\nfier denotesa genericendurant property that isthe commonproperty shared bythe set\nofallendurantpropertiesdenotedbyeachindividualclassifier.\n3.2.2Kindclassifiers\nThesecondtypeofsortalclassifieriswhatiscalledthekindclassifier(Huangetal.黃居仁\n等 1997, Ahrens and Huang 2016). However, the term ‘type classifier’ is probably an even\nmoreappropriatenameastheydifferfromindividualclassifiersbyselectingtypesinsteadof\ntokens(i.e.individuals).Theycoercetypereadingfromthecommonnoun.Thatis,akind/\ntype classifier denotes a property to select a sub-set of the referents of the common noun\ninstead of individuals that share that property. For instance, in 2, the kind/type classifier\n款kuanselectsamongallsweatersthreeparticularstyles(e.g.bydesignorbybrand).\n(2)這三款毛衣,這個冬天很流行。\nzhe__san__kuan__maoyi,zhege__dongtian__hen__liuxing\nthis__three__style(CL)__sweater,this__winter__very__fashionable\nThesethree stylesof sweaterare veryfashionablethiswinter.\n\nHuangLinguaSinica (2015) 1:1 Page10of22\nSimilarly 樣 yang ‘type (CL)’ in3 states that the subjectbought three types ofobjects,\nwithoutcommittingtothenumbertokensofeachtypec.\n(3)他買了三樣東西。\nta__mai__le__san__yang__dongxi\ns/he__buy__PERF__three__type(CL)__things\nS/hebought threedifferent kindsof stuff.\nAs mentioned, 款 kuan refers to properties of members of a type sharing the same\nstyle, such as referring to iPhone 6.1. as 這款手機 zhe kuan shouji ‘this model cell-\nphone’. Similar to individual classifiers, the type selected share properties that are in-\nvariant through time. That is, the existence of the type denoted is continuant over\ndifferent time. Last, but not the least, similar to the generic individual classifier 個\nge, the generic kind classifier 種 zhong selects a under-specified type that can be\nidentified in context. In this usage, 種 zhong is the most generic of all classifiers as it\nselect virtually all common nouns. This is because there are fewer semantic con-\nstraints on which entities can be referred to as types (that which can be referred to\nas individuals).\nIt is important to note that the use of kind/type classifier must denote time-invariant\nenduring properties. For instance, it would be appropriate to use 這一款手機 zhe yi\nkuan shouji ‘this model cell-phone’ to refer to iPhone 6, Samsung, android cell phones,\netc. However, it would not be appropriate to use it to denote the sub-set of cell-phones\nthat are bundled with a service contract. Being bundled with a service contract will\nchangeovertime andisnot anenduring propertythatisindependentoftime.\nFor example, even though any product can be sold with a discount (or mark-up) at a\nprice different from its published price, it is simply infelicitous to use that situation\ndependentpricetorefertothatparticulartypeofproduct.Hence,givenattested‘snapshot’\nataspecifictimeof4a,itisstillappropriatetorefertothatkindofcellphoneas4b,asthis\nlinguisticexpressionreferstoadistinctmodelofcellphonewithapublishedpriceof2,500\ndollars. It can only be referred to as 這一款三千元手機 zhe yi kuan sanqian yuan shouji\n‘the 3,000 dollar model cellphone’. In other words, the kind classifier clearly selects only\ntime-invariant properties and is incompatible with properties whose instantiation is only\ntrueforsomespecifictimeandsituationd.\n(4)a. 這一款三千元手機只賣兩千五\nzhe__yi__kuan__sanqian__yuan__shouji__zhi__mai__liangqianwu\nthis__one__style(CL)__three-thousand__dollar__cellphone__only__sell__two-\nthousand-five\nThis3,000 dollar model cellphone wassoldforonly2,500 dollars.\nb. 這一款兩千五百元手機\nzhe__yi__kuan__liangqianwubai__yuan__shouji\nthis__one__style(CL)__two-thousand-five-hundred__dollar__cellphone\nthis 2,500 dollar model cellphone\nLast, but not the least, please also note that even though D-M compounds with kind\nclassifiers can receive kind readings, (e.g. such as in ‘Dogs are bigger than cats.’), they\n\nHuangLinguaSinica (2015) 1:1 Page11of22\nshould be treated simply as a semantic alternation of the construction, rather than as\nthemeaningofthe classifier.\n3.2.3Eventclassifiers\nLastly,theeventclassifierselectseventnouns,whicharenamesusedtorefertoeventsasen-\ntities (similar to Chierchia’s account of English gerunds). In gerund usage of ‘Swimming is\nfun,’Chierchia(1984)arguedthat‘swimming’referstotheeventinwholeasanentitythatcan\nbe assigned some constant property, instead of the typical process with time-variant aspects\nof instantiations. As such they select entities that are continuant through time. Huang and\nAhrens (2003) argued that in Chinese, such usage is further supported by the existence of\neventclassifiers.Aneventclassifiercaneitherselecteventnouns(suchas會議huiyi‘meeting’\nor比賽bisai‘race,competition’)whichdirectlyencodeeventsasentitiesorcoercesreferen-\ntial eventive meanings from common nouns. For instance 三場電影 san chang dianying\n‘three (scheduled) showings of the movie’ and 兩班公車 liang ban gongche ‘two scheduled\nrunningofpublicbus’.Thesetwoclassifiers,場chang,and班ban,selecteventnounswhich\narenamesofeventsthatoccuraccordingtoa schedule.班banselectspublictransportation\nwhile 場 chang selects drama-like events (i.e. events which progress according to a script).\nThese classifiers select event individuals, and allow them to be enumerated. In other words,\nonceaneventnounco-occurswithaneventclassifier,itlosesitsmeaningofreferringtothe\nevents themselves as occurrants. It now refers to the more abstract concept of the existence\nof each event as an individual. These individual entities, unlike the actual (non-) occurrence\noftheevent,arenotboundtoanytemporalpoint,suchasin5.\n(5)a. 10:49 那班火車,11:23 才到。\n10:49__na__ban__huoche, 11:23cai__dao\n10:49__that__CL__train,11:23 just__arrive\nThe10:49 trainhasjustarrived at11:23.\nb. 三場電影,兩場滿座,一場取消。\nsan__chang__dianying,liang__chang__manzuo,yi__chang__quxiao\nthree__CL__movie,two__CL__full,one__CL__cancel\nOfthethree showingsofthis film,two werefull andonegot cancelled.\nIn the two example sentences in 5, I show that event classifier coerce the reading of\nevent as individuals and hence free from specific temporal reference and eventive in-\nstantiation. Hence a 10:49 train for a particular day/morning is always a 10:49 train, re-\ngardless of when it arrives, even if it gets cancelled. Similar, each scheduled showing of\na film is treated the same, regardless of how many people see the film or even whether\nit was actually shown or not. Since event classifiers refer to the time-invariant aspect of\nanevent,theendurant/perdurant contrastcanbeteasedapart,asillustrated by6.\n(6)10:49 那班飛機,11:23 才起飛。\n10:49__na__ban__feiji, 11:23cai__qifei\n10:49__that__CL__airplane,11:23just__take-off\nThe10:49 flightdidnottakeoffuntil11:23\na. 請問10:49 那班飛機,什麼時候抵達?\nqingwen__10:49__na__ban__feiji,shenme__shihou__dida\n\nHuangLinguaSinica (2015) 1:1 Page12of22\nplease-ask__10:49__that__CL__airplane,which__when__arrive\nCanyoutellmewhen willthe 10:49 flightarrive?\nb. 請問11:23那班飛機,什麼時候抵達。\nqingwen__11:23__na__ban__feiji,shenme__shihou__dida\nplease-ask__11:23__that__CL__airplane,which__when__arrive\nCanyoutellmewhen willthe 11:23 flightarrive?\nGiven an attested flight delay in 6, even with the knowledge of the actual time of tak-\ning off, 6b will be an inappropriate query for the arrival time of the flight. 6a instead is\nthe appropriate query sentence. This is because the event classifier 班 ban, similar to\nindividual classifiers, selects a time-invariant property shared by this type of events.\nThe property 班 ban selects is ‘having the same scheduled time’. For any scheduled\nevent,thescheduledtimeisanenduring propertythatwillnotbeaffectedbytheactual\nevent time. In this particular example, the property of having a specific scheduled\ndeparture time of a flight will not change regardless of whether the flight is on time,\ndelayed, early, or cancelled on a specific date. The actual departure time of a flight,\nhowever, is associated with a specific event instantiation and is not an enduring\nproperty of that flight, and cannot be used to identify that particular type of event.\n6b can only be an appropriate query if there is a flight scheduled for 11:23.\nThe generalization that event classifiers select endurant eventive properties in fact\ncan supplement the coercion account of event classifiers turning concrete object en-\ntities to event entities given in Huang and Ahrens (2003). For example, in 7a-b, as well\nas 6, the original meaning of the head nouns refers to the entities of the telephone set\nandtherainwaterrespectively.\n(7)a. 兩通(未接)電話\nliang__tong__(weijie)__dianhua\ntwo__CL__(unanswered)__telephone\ntwo (unanswered)calls\nb. 好幾陣雨\nhao__ji__zhen__yu\ngood__several__CL__rain\nquite afewrainshowers\nHuang and Ahrens (2003) argued that the event readings are coerced by the classifier\nbut didnot explicate how the coercion happened. Based onthe generalization observed\nso far, a sortal classifier serves as a linguistic device to express a defining property of a\ntype of time-invariant entities. To serve this function to conceptualize events as endur-\nantentities,themostlikelypropertiesthataneventclassifiercanpickupareproperties\nof event structures. For instance, the classifier 通 tong has the original verbal meaning\nof ‘connecting, going through’. As an event classifier, it picks up the property of indi-\nviduating a single successful connection as the starting point to define a calling event as\nan endurant. This can be shared by all telecommunication events and indeed 通 tong is\naneventclassifierforothertelecommunicationeventsincluding電報dianbao‘telegraph’\nor even the newly introduced 短訊 duanxun ‘short message, SMS’. Similarly 陣 zhen’s\noriginal meaningreferstoanepisode ofa meteorological events. As anevent classifier, it\n\nHuangLinguaSinica (2015) 1:1 Page13of22\npicks up the holisticfeatureofthatepisode from onset to ending aswell asthe shared\nfeature of a non-volitional ‘happening’. Intuitively, we could view the function of event\nclassifiersasexpressingthe‘shapesofeventstructure’,asdescribedbyHuangetal.(2000).\nTo sum up, our discussion showed that event classifier selects a time-invariant prop-\nerty. I also showed thatby assuming a sortal classifier must express an ‘enduring’ prop-\nerty shared by the entity type, I can predict that event classifiers must refer to ‘shapes\nof event structures’ and furthermore, it is this expression of shapes of event structures\nthat allows event classifiers to coerce event entity reading from nouns denoting con-\ncreteentities.\n3.3Measurewordsdenoteperdurantproperties\n3.3.1Standardmeasurewords\nMeasure words also have three sub-classes. The proto-typical measure word is a stand-\nard measure word, such as 公斤 gongjin ‘kilogram’ in 三公斤肉 san gongjin rou ‘three\nkilograms of meat’, which are part of the standard measurement system. The standard\nmeasurement system is a property introduced independent of the entity. It is not a\npropertythatisinherentto the entity andindependent oftime. Instead, it refers to per-\ndurant information, as the measurement is only true at a particular point in time of\nthatparticularinstantiationoftheentityandmay varyintime.\n(8) 一公斤肉,煮熟後只剩不到600公克\nyi__gongjin__rou, zhushou__hou__zhi__sheng__budao__600__gongke\none__kilogram__meat,cooked__after__only__left__less__600__gram\nOne kilogramofmeatonly weighslessthan 600grams afterbeingcooked.\nExample 8 shows that the same entity can take different measurements or measure\nwords at different times. The fact that standard measure words stand for time-variant\nproperties can also be illustrated by the fact that an entity can take as many standard\nmeasure words as long as the situation context allows it to be measured by the\nstandard.\nIt is important to note, however, although the property denoted by a standard meas-\nure is inherently perdurant (i.e. time-dependent and not linked to any specific inde-\npendent entity), other linguistic devices can be used to coerce an endurant-continuant\nreadingofanounmodified bya standard measure.\n(9) 這一公斤肉,煮成了三道菜\nzheyi__gongjin__rou,zhucheng__le__san__dao__cai\nthis__one__kilogram__meat,cook-make__LE__three__CL__dish\nThis (piece)ofonekilogrammeatwasmadeintothreedishes.\nIn 9, the weight of the meat is used to establish the identity of the entity (rather than\nproviding measurement). Hence it is considered to be an enduring property and used\nto refer to the same entity even though, as we know, the weight of the meat after being\ncooked has already changed. This interpretation is consistent with the BFO view that\nthe same entity can be described either in terms of SNAP or SPAN ontology to focus\n\nHuangLinguaSinica (2015) 1:1 Page14of22\non different properties. It is also important to note that the perdurant reading in 8\nallows DE-insertion, while the endurant/continuant reading in 9 in is resistant to\nDE-insertion. This issue will be explicated in section 3.4.\n3.3.2Containermeasurewords\nThe same can be said of the container measure words as the second type of measure\nwords. Container measure words, such as 包 bao ‘package,’ 箱 xiang ‘case,’ etc. can in\nprinciple measureany entityas long as thereal world contextallows that entity to be put\ninsidethatparticularcontainer.Inotherwords,acontainermeasureworddenotesatime-\nvariant state where the entity is (envisioned to be) contained inside the type of container\nspecified. The interpretation of the following D-M compounds are situation and context\ndependent: 三包糖 san bao tang ‘three packs of sugar’, 三箱糖 san xiang tang ‘three\ncartons of sugar’, 三包筆 san bao bi ‘three packs of pens’, 三箱筆 san xiang bi ‘three car-\ntonsofpens’.Thereisnowaytoascertaintheactualquantityofobjectsineachcontainer\nwithout explicit knowledge of the particular situations. Like standard measure words,\ncontainermeasurewords’perdurantpropertyisshownbyitshighversatilityinmeasuring\nand denoting properties of all types of entities. In addition, the interpretation of the\nproperty(bothof volumeandwayscontained)ofeachcontainerisalsodependentonthe\ncontainer or the (partially conventionalized) way of packaging involved in defining the\ncontainer. Again, the note on the possibility of borrowing SPAN ontology concept for\ndescriptionaSNAPontology,discussedinthelastsectiononmeasurewords,alsoapplies\nhere. In other words, when required by real world context, the language does allow a\nspeaker to select a perdurant property described by a container classifier to treat it as an\nendurant.\n3.3.3Temporarymeasurewords\nLastly, temporary measure words are often called ‘pseudo-classifiers’ they typically only\ntake the numeral 一 yi ‘one’ (Chao 1968). There are two sub-types of temporary meas-\nure words. The first is derived from a familiar cognate concrete common noun (with\nbody partsbeingsome themoreprominent ones),asin(10).\n(10)a. 一/滿身(的)灰\nyi/man__shen__(de)__hui\none/full__body__(DE)__dust\nabody-ful ofdust\nb.一/滿屋子(的)灰\nyi/man__wuzi__(de)__hui\none/full__room__(DE)__dust\naroomful ofdust\n10 describes a result state where the existence of certain entity is prevalent at a cer-\ntain location. Here a container metaphor is invoked to describe the result state, with\nthe filled-inlocationbeingused asthe temporary measure word. The situation describe\noccurs at a specific time-location and is not enduring for either the entity or the meas-\nure word. When used as an object, it refers to the extent of a result state, as in 11,\nagain underlining theperdurantproperty.\n\nHuangLinguaSinica (2015) 1:1 Page15of22\n(11) 汽車濺了他一身的水\nqiche__jian__le__ta__yi__shen__de__shui\ncar__splatter__PERF__s/he__onel__body__DE__water\nThecar splattered wateralloverhim/her.\nAnother sub-type of temporary measure words involve denoting the prevalence of\ncertainmentalactivities,asin12:\n(12) a. 這是我的一點心意\nzhe__shi__wode__yi__dian__xinyi\nthis__be__mine__one__point__heart\nThisrepresentsmygratitude/heart-feltappreciation.\nb. 他心中有一堆問題\nta__xin__zhong__you__yi__dui__wenti\ns/he__heart__middle__have__one__pile__question\nS/Hehassomany unanswered questiononhis/her mind.\nIn 12, the temporary measure word denotes the extent of mental state. This is again\natime-specificoccurrentandthus,aperdurantproperty.\n3.4Linguisticexpressionofontologicalnotions\n3.4.1ThecorrelationbetweenDE-insertionandperdurantproperties\nInterestingly, the endurant/perdurant contrast observed above corresponds to the\nmorphosyntactic behavior of DE-insertion between the D-M compound and\nthe NP it modifies. This, in fact, leads to the common practice in the field of\nChinese linguistics to use the lack of potential for DE-insertion as a litmus test for\nclassifiers (Huang et al. 黃居仁等 1997, Her and Hsieh 2010, Ahrens and Huang\n2016).\n(13) a. 三本書\nsan__ben__shu\nthree__CL__book\nthreebooks\nb. 三款手機\nsan__kuan__shouji\nthree__type__cellphone\nthreetypesofcellphones\nc. 三場電影\nsan__chang__dianying\nthree__CL__movie\nthree showingsofmovie\n(14) a. 一/滿身(的)灰\nyi/man__shen__(de)__hui\none/full__body__(DE)__dust\nabody-ful ofdust\n\nHuangLinguaSinica (2015) 1:1 Page16of22\nb. 三公斤(的)書\nsan__gongjin__(de)__shu\nthree__kilogram__(DE)__book\nthreekilogramsof books\nc. 三包(的)書\nsan__bao__(de)__shu\nthree__package__(DE)book\nthreepackagesof books\nThere is a clear contrast between endurant M, i.e. sortal classifiers in 13, and perdur-\nant M. i.e. measure words in 14, which demonstrate that DE-insertion is allowed only\nwhen the M selects perdurant properties and that in general, DE-insertion does not\nchangethemeaningofperdurantD-Mcompounds.\n3.4.2WhenDE-insertionappliestosortalclassisifers\nThis generalization in fact can be extended to even seeming exceptions with when DE-\ninsertion occurs with sortal classifiers, as the examples in 15 allow perdurant readings\nonly.\n(15) a. 一百回的水滸傳\nyibai__hui__de__shuihuzhuan\none-hundred__chapter__DE__Water-Margin\ntheone hundred chapteredition ofWaterMargin\nb. 一百二十回的水滸傳\nyibaiershi__hui__de__shuihuzhuan\none-hundred-and-twenty__chapter__DE__Water-Margin\ntheone hundred andtwentychapteredition ofWaterMargin\n回 hui in15 is infact an event classifier for literaryworks, referring to both scenes in\nplay and chapters in classical vernacular novels (which typically originated from 評書\npingshu ‘oral storytelling’). As a sortal classifier, it should not allow DE-insertion. In 15,\nwith DE-insertion, the interpretation is, in fact, perdurant. That is, instead of the enu-\nmerating function of a typical D-M compound, 15a and 15b are used to differentiate\ndistinct editions of Water Margin, which is known to have multiple editions containing\ndifferent numbers of chapters. In other words, 水滸傳 shuihuzhuan ‘Water Margin’\nhere is not longer a single time-invariant entity, it is now viewed as a collection of\nendurant entities (i.e. each different edition of Water Margin is considered a separate\nentity). These entities are, however, differentiated by the situation specific property of\nthenumberofchapters they contain.\nSimilarly, in 16a and 16b, the examples involving internal modification of individual\nclassifiersunexpectedly allow DE-insertion.A small setofadjectivesisallowed tooccur\nbefore sortal classifiers to describe the situation specific properties of the entity (paper\nin our examples). In such usages, the property the classifiers denote becomes time-\nspecific and perdurant. And linguistically this is clearly marked by the allowance of\nDE-insertion. In addition, comparing 16c-d with 16a-b underlines the assignment of\nperdurant properties.\n\nHuangLinguaSinica (2015) 1:1 Page17of22\n(16) a.

In other words, the direct modification of the entity does not change the\nendurantpropertyoftheentity.Thiscontrastnicelyillustratethatthelinguisticexpression\nof byDE-insertion infactmarks theperdurantpropertyoftheD-Mcompounds. Insum,\nseeming exceptions of sortal classifiers allowing DE-insertion are instances where the\nDE-insertion coerces a perdurant reading. Hence, I have showed that de–insertion is\nallowed in D-M construction when M selects perdurant properties of the entity it\nmodifies. This generalization about the semantic function of DE-insertion is consistent\nwithanotherobservationmadebyChao(1968)between白花油baihuayou‘PakFahYeow’\n白花的油baihuadeyou‘a(n)(essential)oilmadefromawhiteflower,’asillustratedin17.\n(17) a. 白花油\nbaihuayou\nwhite__flower__oil\nPakFahYeow\nb. 白花的油\nbaihua__de__you\nwhite__flower__DE__oil\na(n)(essential)oilmadefromawhite flower\nExample 17 shows that 白花油 baihuayou ‘Pak FahYeow’, a proper name for a prod-\nuct with time-invariant referent, does not allow DE-insertion, while 白花的油 baihua\nde you ‘a(n) (essential) oil made from a white flower’, which refers to time-variant refer-\nent depending on which kind of flower is used to produce the (essential) oil on each\noccasion, must be used with 的 de ‘DE’ inserted. Following the generalization obtained\nso far, we can account for this contrast observed in Chao (1968) by hypothesizing that\nthe insertion of 的 de ‘DE’ in a compound or noun phrase requires a time-variant/\nperdurant interpretation of the pre-head element.\n\nHuangLinguaSinica (2015) 1:1 Page18of22\n3.4.3DoesDE-insertionmarktime-variantproperty?\n的 de ‘DE’, as the most frequent word and character in Chinese, accounts for up to 5%\nof word frequency in a corpus (e.g. Chen et al. 1996), and remains one of the most\nchallenging function words to be accounted for in Chinese. Contrary to pervasive lit-\nerature in Chinese linguistics, following Zhu 朱德熙 (1961), trying to differentiate a\nrange of different functions and meaning of 的 de ‘DE’, Huang (1987) argued that all 的\nde ‘DE’ in Chinese has one single syntactic function: to mark the unit following it as\nsyntactic head. In addition, Huang 黃居仁 (2013) suggested that such head marking\nfunctions could be treated as a construction. Based on the occurrence of DE-insertion\nwith D-M phrases, and supported by examples involving other compounds, it seem\nthat perhaps 的 de ‘DE’ may have a single uniform function of marking the property\ndenoted by preceding element as time-variant and perdurant. Thisseems to be a plaus-\nible account given the emergent account that all relative clauses, marked by 的 de ‘DE’\nbefore its head noun, are all restrictive (Shi 2016). It seems that the different accounts\nattempting to give a uniform linguistic function to 的 de ‘DE’can in fact be unified by\nthe conceptual motivation that 的 de ‘DE’ is a linguistic expression of the ontological\nnotion of perdurant in Chinese. That is, the phrase before de introduces time or situ-\nation dependent property, which intersects with the endurant and/or perdurant entity\nrepresentedbythehead nountoestablishamorerestrictive meaning.\nThisontologicalmeaningisalsoconsistentwiththetype-shifting formalaccountpro-\nposed in Huang (1987) where de introduces type-shifting and will look for a situation\nspecific (in the temporal-locational-event continuum) variable to bind to the preceding\nclause, as illustrated in 18 where the most typical ‘light’ head nouns to follow de are in\nfact time, situation and location (adopted from Huang 黃居仁 2013). In 18a-c, for ex-\nample, the element preceding 的 de ‘DE’ each denotes a specific situation, which then\nintersects with the ‘light’ head noun indicating a situationtype that stipulates aparticu-\nlartime-variant situation.\n(18) a. 開會的時候\nkaihui__de__shihou\nconvene-meeting__DE__time\nwhen meeting isheld\nb. 去過的地方\nqu__guo__de__difang\ngo__GUO__DE__place\nplace(s)onehasbeento\nc.没有的事\nmeiyou__de__shi\nNEG-exist__DE__matter\nImpossible!/Nonsense!\nA full account of the all Chinese expressions involving 的 de ‘DE’ is clearly beyond\nthe scope ofthe current paper. However, based onontologicalinterpretations discussed\nin this paper, there are two possible interpretations. The first, consistent with the upper\nontology design of DOLCE, is that the insertion of 的 de ‘DE’ marks the preceding\nelementasdenoting perdurant properties. Thesecond, consistent with thetreatmentof\n\nHuangLinguaSinica (2015) 1:1 Page19of22\ncontinuant/occurrent contrast of BFO, is that the insertion of 的 de ‘DE’ marks the\nshift to a SPAN (i.e. four-dimensional spatiotemporal) ontological view, and hence\nunderlines time-dependent properties. Either ontological account will have important\nimplications for explanatory accounts of Chinese grammar.\n4 Conclusion\nI have shown in this paper that the Chinese classifier system offers robust linguistic ex-\npression of the ontological notions of endurant vs. perdurant. In particular, the dichot-\nomy is encoded with the sortal classifier vs. measure words sub-systems of the Chinese\nclassifiers. In addition, I have also shown that DE-insertion in D-M compounds is an\nexplicit and reliable mark to underline time-variant properties, either marking the shift\nto a SPAN ontological view or to directly mark the preceding property as endurant. I\nhaveshownthatDE-insertionnotonlyappliestoall D-Mcompoundsinvolvingmeasure\nwords(whichdenotesperdurantproperties),butalsotospecificsortalclassifierconstruc-\ntions where a time-variant meaning is coerced. I have also given additional examples to\nshowthatthemarkingofperdurantproperties/SPANontologicalviewmaybeasemantic\nfeatureofmanyde-constructionsinChinese.Takingthisintoconsiderationinadditionto\nthe intuitive nouny/verby categorical dichotomy, I claim that ontological notions do find\nlinguisticexpressioninChinese,similartowhatChao(1955)foundwhenlookingfor the\nlinguisticexpressionoflogicalrelationsinChinese.\nIn addition to potential extension of a unified conceptual account of 的 de ‘DE’ in\nChinese, our study of the expression of endurant/perdurant ontological dichotomy in\nChinese has implications for future studies on the relation between ontology and lan-\nguage as knowledge systems. For instance, event and kinds as endurant individuals are\nnot specifiedinthe currentversionofupperontologyofBFO,DOLCE(aswellasmany\nother competing ontologies), and it remains open for further research to determine if\nthe evidence from Chinese classifiers requires the addition of such nodes. Moreover, as\nthe classifier system involves both description and measurement of different qualities, a\nfull explanatory account of the system must address the interaction between entity and\nquality. For example, further work needs to be done to determine if such qualities are\nbetter treated independently of entities (i.e. the DOCLE approach) or as dependent on\nentities in order to allow shift of ontological views (i.e. the BFO approach). This is a\nfundamental ontological decision and I hope that further exploration of the linguistic\nexpressionsofontologyinChinesewillshedlight onthis importantissue.\nLast but not the least, as mentioned earlier, the standard position of current studies\non ontology is that the formal ontology is the rigorous and logically robust system\nwhich is the shared foundation of knowledge representation through either domain\nspecific (and potentially inconsistent) local ontologies, as well as less rigorous and po-\ntentiallyconflictinglanguagespecificontologies.Howeve",
