When the knowledge in question is knowledge about human behavior, the emergent\nimage must bear a human face. If it doesn’t, the mind goes blank when we look at it, irre-\nspective of how detailed or precise it is. So there are two tasks, really: first, the assembly of\nthe pieces, and second, the discernment of a human face.\n— Melvin Konner (2002, p. xvi)\nFor the past 15 years, a framed reproduction of a prehistoric cave painting has been\nhanging above the fireplace in my home. The original pictograph is located at one of the\nmany ancient rock art sites in southern Africa, some of which are at least 27,000 years\nold. Following traditions of style and content that were maintained for millennia, it\nportrays, in shades of maroon, yellow, black, and white, a variety of giraffes, elephants,\nrhinoceros, and eland, as well as several small groups of very tall, thin people, some\ncarrying spears and others torches.\nFor me, this beautiful work of art is not just a nice decoration; it is also a vivid reminder\nof the lifeways that our hunter- gatherer ancestors led for over 90% of human history\n(Reich, 2018). Although those lifeways were quite different from our own, they undoubt-\nedly depended on languages that were no less expressive than those currently spoken all\nover the world. After all, people then had essentially the same cognitive capacities that we\nhave now, including the ability to weave the fabrics of their cultures with words. That is\nwhy, if I extrapolate rather liberally from recent findings about the conversational patterns\nof contemporary Ju/’ hoan (!Kung) Bushmen in southern Africa, I can easily imagine that\ntheir forebears in the deep past— forebears like the people illustrated in my painting—\ndevoted most of their day talk to the nitty- gritty details of food sharing, kinship dues, and\nland rights, whereas at night they gathered around their fires to relax and tell elaborate\nstories that were richly embellished with gestures, sound effects, and bursts of song, that\nwere by turns amusing, exciting, and endearing, and that took listeners on virtual journeys\nthrough space and time so as to inform them about the social and emotional intricacies of\nmarriage, intergroup relations, and trance healing (Weissner, 2014).\nBut while it is not hard for me to imagine in general terms what the people in my\npainting tended to talk about so many years ago, it is nearly impossible for me to get\na specific sense of what their language was like, especially regarding the aspects of it\nthat interest me most— namely, the meanings of its major symbolic units, which is\nto say, its morphemes, words, idioms, and grammatical constructions. This is not just\nbecause the language in question existed before the invention of writing and hence\nwas never recorded, or because its referential resources cannot be fully reconstructed\nfrom information about the contemporary tongues that descended from it. It is also,\nvii\n\nviii Preface\nand more fundamentally, because even though there are many similarities in how\nhuman languages carve up the world into multifarious conceptual categories, there\nare far more differences. Indeed, these differences are so dramatic that when speakers\nof one language— say, English— first encounter some of the words and phrases\nthat are frequently used by speakers of an unrelated language— say, Central Yup’ik\n(Eskimo- Aleut, Alaska), or Tzeltal (Mayan, Mexico), or Yélî Dnye (Papuan, Rossel\nIsland)1— they often find the meanings of those expressions to be quite surprising\nand peculiar, if not, in some cases, exotic. As Evans (2010, p. 45) observes, even sea-\nsoned scholars are frequently gobsmacked by what they discover in the course of\ntheir research: “One of the most exciting things about linguistic fieldwork is the way\nit continuously pushes the bounds of preconceived possibility, by stumbling upon\n‘unimaginable’ languages— those that would never have been thought possible.”\nAccording to the best current estimate, nearly 6,500 mutually unintelligible languages\nare (or recently were) spoken on the planet (Hammarström, 2016).2 And as Pagel (2012,\np. viii) points out, “this is more different systems of communication in a single mammal\nspecies— for that is what we are—t han there are mammal species.” Unfortunately, how-\never, many living languages are either endangered or already dying, and it is likely that\nat least half of them will go extinct during this century, as a few dominant ones, such as\nEnglish and Mandarin Chinese, gradually take over the world (Crystal, 2000). This is\nnothing short of tragic, since every language not only provides a unique window into the\nworkings of the human mind, but is also bound up with an ethnic group’s identity and\nself- esteem. In a recent article in the New York Times about an inspiring effort to preserve\none particular language— specifically, Southern Haida (Haida, British Columbia)—t he\nanthropologist Wade Davis captured the significance of the project in a rather poignant\nmanner: “The loss of one language is akin to clear- cutting an old- growth forest of the\nmind. The world’s complex web of myths, beliefs and ideas—t he ethnosphere—i s torn,\njust as the loss of a species weakens the biosphere” (Porter, 2017).\nFigure.

Within the broad field of linguistics, the division\nthat concentrates on cross- linguistic similarities and differences is called typology,\nand within it the branch that focuses even more narrowly on conceptual represen-\ntation is called semantic typology (e.g., Evans, 2010, 2011; Malt & Majid, 2013;\nMoore et al., 2015). Although this area of specialization is still maturing, it has begun\nto flourish during the past few decades, as shown by increasingly systematic and in-\nsightful studies of numerous conceptual realms, including colors, plants and animals\n(i.e., ethnobiology), body parts, landscapes, spatial relations, possession, and several\nspheres of action, such as giving, cutting and breaking, putting and taking, and eating\nand drinking. These investigations have shown that far- flung languages all over the\nworld display many intriguing correspondences in both the content and structure\nof the concepts they encode— correspondences that may stem from commonalities\nin people’s bodies, brains, communicative behaviors, and physical and social\nenvironments. At the same time, however, these investigations have also revealed a\ntremendous amount of cross- linguistic diversity in the lexical partitioning and pack-\naging of particular semantic domains, and in the aspects of experience that speakers\nmust regularly express in grammatical constructions and hence habitually track.\nNow, in response to such variation, one could just throw up one’s hands and ex-\nclaim, “So what? It all originates from the same underlying semantic system.” Such\nan attitude, however, would treat as disproportionately special whatever universal\nconstraints on meaning turn out to be true, and downplay as comparatively trivial all of\nthe cross- linguistic conceptual differences that have been disclosed. In sharp contrast,\nan increasing number of scholars have been arguing that if there is any asymmetry of\nsignificance, it actually goes the other way, since cross-l inguistic differences in meaning\ncome primarily from culture, and culture is what ultimately explains the evolutionary\nsuccess of our species (e.g., Tomasello, 1999, 2014; Richerson & Christiansen, 2013;\n3 https:// www.degruyter.com/ view/ serial/ 16099#\n4 http:// wals.info\n\nx Preface\nHenrich, 2016; Boyd, 2018; Heyes, 2018). Here is how Stephen Levinson, one of the\nmost influential semantic typologists, recently put it (Levinson, 2012b, p. 397):\nIn the language sciences, there is a slow, growing realization that this diversity is the\nmost striking feature of human language—t here is no other animal on the planet, as\nfar as we know, which has such myriad variants of form and meaning at every level\nin its communication system. What this feature of language ought to convey to us\nwith special force is that culture is the peculiar human adaptive trick that has made it\npossible for us to invade and dominate almost every terrestrial niche on the planet.\nClassical cognitive science treats humans like an asocial species without culture, and\nin doing so, it misses the heart of the human phenomenon.\nSemantic typology has already had a strong influence on developmental\npsychologists who investigate the acquisition of language during childhood (e.g.,\nBowerman & Levinson, 2001; Guo et al., 2008) and on cognitive scientists who ex-\nplore the relation between language and thought (e.g., Gentner & Goldin- Meadow,\n2003; Malt & Wolff, 2010). Unfortunately, however, it has not yet had much impact\non the sizable branch of cognitive neuroscience that studies the organization, repre-\nsentation, and processing of concepts in the brain. To be sure, this field of research has\nbeen making spectacular progress in illuminating the large- scale cortical networks—\nand, to some extent, the fine- grained cell assemblies— that subserve both verbal and\nnonverbal concepts (e.g., Binder & Desai, 2011; Pulvermüller, 2013a; Yee et al., 2013;\nClarke & Tyler, 2015; Kemmerer, 2015c; Lambon Ralph et al., 2017). But it has been\nlaboring, for the most part, under the mistaken assumption that the concepts found\nin English and a few other familiar languages exemplify those found in languages\nworldwide. Because of this powerful bias, which is usually implicit, very few scholars\nhave voiced any concern about the fact that the lion’s share of empirical and theoret-\nical work has been based on what Henrich et al. (2010) provocatively call WEIRD\nsocieties— i.e., societies that are Western(ized), educated, industrial, rich, and dem-\nocratic. Consequently, the field as a whole has so far failed to take into account the\nhuge variety of semantic systems that are manifested in the roughly 6,500 living lan-\nguages around the globe and that are also, ipso facto, implemented in the brains of the\nspeakers.\nIn light of these considerations, the main goal of this book is to raise awareness\nabout the many ways in which semantic typology can contribute to cognitive neu-\nroscience, with an eye toward showing that no neuroscientific theory of human con-\nceptual knowledge can ever achieve comprehensive, species- wide coverage unless it\naccommodates the remarkable range of cross-l inguistic similarities and differences in\nthe lexical and grammatical representation of meaning.\nThe purpose of Part I is to elaborate the typological and neuroscientific approaches\nto studying concepts. Chapter 1, “The Perspective from Semantic Typology,” begins\nby describing the widespread tendency to incorrectly assume that one’s own language\nmaps onto reality in a natural and impartial way. Then it devotes separate sections to\nlexical and grammatical semantics, in each case reviewing cross- linguistic research on\nuniversals and idiosyncrasies, conceptual fields, and coding patterns. Next, Chapter 2,\n“The Perspective from Cognitive Neuroscience,” first elaborates how, in this area of in-\nquiry, most theories of conceptual knowledge posit both modal (i.e., sensory, motor,\n\nxi Preface\nand affective) and transmodal (i.e., integrative) levels of representation. Then it goes\non to discuss representational similarity spaces in the brain, the lack of sufficient\nneuroscientific attention to grammatical semantics, and the captivating notion that\nlinguistic communication involves brain- to- brain coupling.\nThe aim of Part II is to show that a synthesis of the two approaches surveyed in\nPart I can lead to a more unified and inclusive understanding of several domains of\nconcrete meaning— domains that I have deliberately chosen so as to maximize the\npotential for inter- disciplinary cross- fertilization.5 Most importantly, all three of the\nchapters in this central part of the book (but especially Chapters 3 and 4) make two\noverarching points: on the one hand, many cross-l inguistic conceptual phenomena\nconform to, and hence help to substantiate, salient results and ideas in cognitive neu-\nroscience; on the other hand, current neuroscientific theories and research programs\nmay need to be revised and expanded to handle the full range of semantic variation.\nHere’s a brief preview of the main topics that are covered. Chapter 3, “Objects,” first\ndiscusses four conceptual domains that have received substantial attention in both se-\nmantic typology and cognitive neuroscience— namely, plants, animals, artifacts, and\nbody parts—a nd then it turns to two realms of grammatical meaning that have been\nstudied much more intensively in the former field than in the latter— namely, posses-\nsion and nominal classification systems. Chapter 4, “Actions,” has a similar structure. It\ninitially addresses several conceptual domains that have been explored from the dual\nperspectives of typology and neuroscience— namely, motion events, and events of\ncutting, breaking, and opening— and then it shifts to some other semantic spheres\nand representational strategies that have been carefully examined in typology but\nmostly, if not completely, neglected in neuroscience— namely, events of putting and\ntaking, serial verb constructions, and verbal classification systems. Lastly, Chapter 5,\n“Spatial Relations,” focuses on how people talk about the locations of objects and\nactions. It begins by describing how three different kinds of spatial relations— namely,\ntopological, projective, and deictic— have been studied in great detail in semantic ty-\npology, and then it discusses the surprising fact that, for reasons that remain obscure,\nso far only a few sectors of this rich conceptual terrain have been mined by cognitive\nneuroscientists.\nScattered throughout the neuroscience sections of these three core chapters, there\nare suggestions for new experiments involving various languages. The main purpose\nof these proposals is to demonstrate that, when one takes the perspective of semantic\ntypology, one can formulate novel predictions about the cortical architecture of con-\nceptual knowledge. Some of these experiments could potentially be conducted. But\nbecause others concern languages spoken by small groups of people in remote parts\nof the world, it is unlikely that the predictions could ever be tested. In such cases,\n5 Both semantic typology and cognitive neuroscience have been making significant headway in the\ninvestigation of abstract concepts, but this book is restricted mainly to concrete concepts, largely in\norder to keep the length within reasonable limits. In addition, I should note that although much of the\nbook is about various conceptual domains, I will refrain from trying to formulate a precise definition\nof the term domain, and will instead allow it to remain fairly intuitive, in keeping with current practice\nin both semantic typology and cognitive neuroscience. I will also use the terms domain, realm, field,\nsphere, and arena more or less interchangeably, as well as the terms conceptual and semantic.\n\nxii Preface\nhowever, the suggestions may still serve as useful thought exercises, since they deal\nwith theoretically and empirically important, yet hitherto unrecognized, aspects of\nthe neural representation of concepts— aspects that are most clearly viewed from the\nvantage point of typology.\nPart III rounds off the book by addressing two questions of a more general na-\nture. Chapter 6, “How Do Language- Specific Concepts Relate to Cognition?,” tackles\nthe classic issue of whether language affects thought and perception. The following\nargument is advanced: many forms of cognition do not necessarily rely on language-\nspecific concepts; nonetheless, such concepts do sometimes influence a variety of\ncognitive processes, as predicted by Whorf’s (1956) linguistic relativity hypothesis.\nIn addition, this chapter emphasizes the need for more neuroscientific work on this\ntopic, and it exposes some interpretive challenges facing recent evidence that verbal\nand nonverbal semantic tasks often have partly shared cortical underpinnings. Finally,\nChapter 7, “Are We Ever Conscious of Concepts?,” follows Jackendoff (1987, 2012),\nPrinz (2012), and several other scholars in defending the counter- intuitive position\nthat concepts always operate below the surface of awareness. It also shows that, if this\nposition is right, it raises serious problems for what are now the two most prominent\nneuroscientific theories of consciousness— namely, the Global Neuronal Workspace\nTheory (Dehaene & Naccache, 2001; Dehaene & Changeux, 2011; Dehaene, 2014;\nDehaene et al., 2014, 2017) and the Integrated Information Theory (Tononi, 2004,\n2008, 2012a, 2012b; Oizumi et al., 2014; Tononi & Koch, 2015; Tononi et al., 2016;\nMassimini & Tononi, 2018).\nBefore commencing, some acknowledgments are in order. As I was writing this\nbook, I benefited greatly from the encouragement of several friends and colleagues,\nespecially Larry Barsalou, Rutvik Desai, Ed Fox, Ad Foolen, Elaine Francis, and\nBrad Mahon. In addition, Asifa Majid and Jamie Reilly were kind enough to read the\nwhole manuscript and provide valuable feedback— Asifa from the perspective of se-\nmantic typology, and Jamie from that of cognitive neuroscience. This led to many\nimprovements, and I’m very grateful to both of them. Furthermore, Joan Bossert, my\neditor at Oxford University Press, has been supportive from the very outset. And fi-\nnally, I owe the greatest debt of gratitude to my wonderful wife, Natalya Kaganovich,\nwho has boosted my spirits during the rough stages of this project, shared my joys\nduring the smooth ones, and frequently reminded me, with her laughter, kindness,\nand companionship, that, amazingly enough, there’s actually much more to life than\nwondering about the neural substrates of seemingly exotic languages.\n\nPART I\nTwo Perspectives\non Concepts\n\n1\nTHE PERSPECTIVE FROM SEMANTIC TYPOLOGY\nI emphasize the range of linguistic variation because that’s the fundamentally interesting\nthing about language from a comparative point of view. We are the only known species\nwhose communication system is profoundly variable in both form and content. . . .\n— Stephen Levinson (2003a, p. 29)\nINTRODUCTION\nThe primary purpose of every human language is to convey meaning, and semantic ty-\npology is the branch of linguistic typology that explores how different languages fulfill\nthis function not only in ways that reflect deep underlying regularities, but also in ways\nthat are remarkably diverse. This chapter provides a synopsis of this explicitly cross-\nlinguistic approach to studying concepts, with the aim of giving readers enough back-\nground to understand and appreciate the more detailed typological data covered in\nPart II (see also Harrison, 2007; Koptjevskaja- Tamm et al., 2007; Evans, 2010, 2011;\nMalt & Majid, 2013; Majid, 2015; Moore et al., 2015; Bohnemeyer, 2019). The first\nsection focuses on the fact that most people, including cognitive neuroscientists, are\nhighly susceptible to mistakenly thinking that the concepts conveyed by the words in\ntheir language represent the world in an objective manner that is self- evident and inev-\nitable. The next two sections then introduce some basic aspects of semantic typology\nby discussing a variety of cross-l inguistic similarities and differences in the encoding\nof concepts, first with regard to lexical semantics, and then with regard to grammatical\nsemantics.\nTHE APPARENT NATURALNESS\nOF ONE’S OWN LANGUAGE\nWe humans are extremely group- minded creatures. Indeed, some scholars have\nargued that our extraordinary success as a species derives primarily from our zoo-\nlogically unique ability to form complex cultures in which everyone cooperatively\nthinks and acts according to certain standards that are not only collectively under-\nstood and adopted, but also transmitted across generations, with the consequence that\ninnovations gradually accumulate through a kind of ratchet effect (Tomasello, 1999,\n2014; Richerson & Boyd, 2006; Sterelny, 2012; Richerson & Christiansen, 2013;\nHenrich, 2016; Laland, 2017; Boyd, 2018; Heyes, 2018). According to one version\n3\n\n4 Concepts in the Brain\nof this story, namely Tomasello’s (2014) “shared intentionality hypothesis,” during\nlate hominin evolution, perhaps around 200,000 years ago, increases in population\nsize and inter- group competition led to cognitive adaptations for constructing the es-\nsential elements of cultural common ground— that is, the practices, customs, attitudes,\ninstitutions, etc., that define a particular society and form the bedrock of its members’\ngroup identity. Examples of such shared knowledge and skills include tool- making\nmethods, food- sharing rules, religious rituals, and so on. As Tomasello (2014, p. 92)\nputs it, “there are collectively accepted perspectives on things (e.g., how we classify\nthe animals of the forest, how we constitute our governing council) and collectively\nknown standards for how particular roles in particular cultural practices should be\nperformed— indeed, must be performed— if one is to be a member of the group.” This\npassage highlights the important point that because this group- level or “we” mode of\nthinking and acting evolved to promote efficient coordination among the members of\na particular culture, it typically has a normative slant, encouraging people to not only\nconform to the traditional lifeways of their community, but also regard those lifeways\nas natural and appropriate.\nNow, for any given society, cultural common ground consists largely of conceptual\ncommon ground, and conceptual common ground consists largely of word meanings.\nAfter all, word meanings are essentially conventional—i .e., socially sanctioned and\nshared— ways of categorizing experiences for communicative purposes, and even\nthe smallest modern lexicons contain thousands of items (Pawley, 2006). According\nto Tomasello (2014), this has tremendous cognitive significance because it implies\nthat, from early childhood onward, people do not have to invent their own ways of\nconceptualizing things; instead, they just have to learn the prepackaged concepts that\nare encoded by the words in the local language and that embody, in crystallized form,\nthe collective intelligence amassed by the entire cultural group over a long period of\nhistorical time (see also Gelman & Roberts, 2017).\nMoreover, consistent with the normative nature of the community standards that\nhold cultures together, people often develop the intuition that the ready- made and\nwidely shared words in their language capture inherent, objective, and obvious aspects\nof the world. For instance, Malt and Majid (2013) observe that because monolingual\nEnglish speakers routinely distinguish between green and blue, cup and glass, slice and\nchop, on and in, etc., they tend to think that such familiar, collectively endorsed con-\nceptual distinctions map onto reality in a fairly straightforward and impartial manner.\nIn the same vein, Wierzbicka (2014, p. 6) notes that “the conviction that the words of\nour native language fit the world as it really is, is deeply rooted in the thinking of many\npeople.” She also shows, however, that the proclivity to treat the meanings of English\nwords as being “given” by the world is rampant not only among ordinary English\nspeakers, but also among Anglophone scholars, especially those who have never had\nthe psychologically disorienting experience of learning a foreign language and thereby\nbeing forced to recognize the cultural contingency of their native language. Such\nscholars, including those who study human cognition and behavior, are often una-\nware that although English has both global prestige and a scientific glow, most of its\nconventionalized concepts are actually rather parochial, reflecting forms of attention\nand strategies of categorization that differ significantly from those exhibited by other\nlanguages. This is exemplified by the fact that, as Wierzbicka (2014) demonstrates,\nseemingly natural terms like mouse, table, creek, morning, lunch, teenager, niece, anger,\n\n5 The Perspective from Semantic Typology\nkindness, commonsense, privacy, and cooperation have no exact translation equivalents\nin many, if not most, of the roughly 6,500 languages scattered around the globe. Even\nmore strikingly, Evans and Levinson (2009) point out that some languages lack\nwhat most English speakers would consider to be quite elementary and indispen-\nsable expressions, such as spatial notions like left of, numerals like seven, and logical\nconnectives like or.\nIn the current context, the reason this matters is because it underscores one of the\nfundamental ways in which semantic typology can expand the scope of cognitive neu-\nroscience and help it overcome its biases and limitations. As mentioned in the Preface,\nand in keeping with Wierzbicka’s (2014) remarks about Anglophone scholars in other\nfields, it appears that the vast majority of cognitive neuroscientists who study concepts\nerroneously presuppose that a substantial proportion of the concepts encoded in\nEnglish are self- evident and hence likely to be encoded in other languages as well. As\na result, these researchers tend to assume that the human brain contains a single, al-\nbeit broadly distributed, conceptual system whose content and design are more or less\nthe same for everyone everywhere, regardless of what language they happen to speak.\nThis unwarranted assumption, which is usually tacit, frequently fuels another unwar-\nranted assumption, which is also usually tacit, namely that whenever new discoveries\nare made about the neural representation and organization of English word meanings,\nthey can safely be generalized to other languages. To be sure, a variety of factors do\nconstrain the cross- linguistic encoding of concepts, and some of them may reflect uni-\nversal, perhaps even innate, properties of the brain. But make no mistake: there is also\na huge amount of diversity in the meanings expressed by the thousands of languages\ncurrently spoken on the planet, and this diversity bears directly on cognitive neuro-\nscience, since it must ultimately be accommodated by any adequate theory of how\nconcepts are implemented in the brain.\nPart II of this book summarizes a number of detailed typological studies of the\ncross- linguistic representation of particular conceptual domains, and discusses\nhow they can contribute to cognitive neuroscience. Here, however, the aim is much\nsimpler: to convey a general sense of how semantic typology works and what it can\nreveal about the nature of concepts. To that end, the next two sections describe some\nof the major ways in which languages converge and diverge in the encoding of both\nlexical and grammatical aspects of meaning.\nLEXICAL SEMANTICS\nLoosely speaking, lexical semantics encompasses the meanings of nouns, verbs, and\nadjectives, which are usually regarded as the three main “open classes” of words, since\ntheir inventories are often in flux as old items fall into disuse and new ones are created.1\nMore strictly speaking, however, lexical semantics includes only the grammatically\n1 It is worth noting, however, that some languages, like Kalam (Trans- New Guinea, Papua New\nGuinea) have very small and fairly fixed inventories of verbs (this is illustrated later in this chapter,\nand also in the section on serial verb constructions in Chapter 4). In addition, some languages, like\nKham (Tibeto- Burman, Nepal), only have a few adjectives (Dixon, 2010b), and others, like Lao (Tai\nKadai, Laos), arguably have none at all (Enfield, 2007).\n\n6 Concepts in the Brain\nirrelevant conceptual features of these word classes, i.e., the features that do not af-\nfect the range of morphological and/o r syntactic constructions that the words can\noccur in. This can be clarified by considering the two English nouns book and mud.\nPrototypically, the former word has to do with collections of printed, written, or blank\nsheets of paper, whereas the latter word has to do with soft, wet, dark earth. These\nare the sorts of rich, informative conceptual features that give each word its unique\nmeaning, and they fall under the rubric of lexical semantics because they have no in-\nfluence on the grammatical behavior of the words. It is apparent, however, that the two\nwords do differ grammatically— for instance, book can easily be pluralized (There are\nthree books on the porch), whereas mud cannot (*There are three muds on the porch).2 But\nthis particular difference cannot be traced to any of the conceptual features mentioned\nearlier; instead, it derives from the fact that book specifies a type of discrete object,\nthereby making it a pluralizable count noun, whereas mud specifies a type of sub-\nstance, thereby making it a non- pluralizable mass noun. Because these highly sche-\nmatic specifications affect the grammatical possibilities of the words, they belong to\nthe realm of grammatical semantics— a topic addressed further below.\nLexical- semantic idiosyncrasies and universals\nAs already noted, it is often assumed that languages worldwide have myriad\ncommonalities regarding the concepts encoded in their lexicons. For instance, Li and\nGleitman (2002, p. 266) begin their paper with the following paragraph:\nLanguage has means for making reference to the objects, relations, properties, and\nevents that populate our everyday world. It is possible to suppose that these linguistic\ncategories and structures are more- or- less straightforward mappings from a pre-\nexisting conceptual space, programmed into our biological nature: humans invent\nwords that label their concepts. This perspective would begin to account for the fact\nthat the grammars and lexicons of all languages are broadly similar, despite historical\nisolation and cultural disparities among their users.\nLupyan (2016, p. 521) points out that this passage exemplifies a fairly widespread view\n(e.g., Pinker, 1994; Bloom, 2002; Clark, 2004; Waxman & Gelman, 2009). Extensive\ntypological research has shown, however, that such a view is deeply misguided.\nDespite the pervasive availability of easy- to- use computer programs that make trans-\nlation seem effortless and trivial,3 there is now abundant evidence that most of the\nwords in any given language do not really have true matches, with identical denota-\ntional and connotational ranges, in the vocabularies of other languages (for an author-\nitative review, see Malt & Majid, 2013, and for an illuminating literary demonstration,\nsee Weinberger & Paz, 1987).\n2 A qualification: Some people might argue that the sentence There are three muds on the porch can in\nfact be felicitous, but I submit that this is only possible under the special “variety” or “kind” construal\nof muds, and not under the standard “counting” construal (Langacker, 1987).\n3 For example: https:// translate.google.com\n\n7 The Perspective from Semantic Typology\nSuch exuberant lexical- semantic diversity may seem surprising, but it actually\nfollows from the fact that every language is the outcome of a massive constraint sat-\nisfaction problem for which there are countless possible solutions. On the one hand,\nin all domains of experience, such as shapes, movements, and emotions, people can\nmake innumerable discriminations, any of which could potentially be judged worthy\nof conventionalizing with separate words. But on the other hand, every language must\nrestrict itself to a limited number of labeled categories so as to avoid overwhelming its\nspeakers’ learning and memory capacities. Thus, the precision of lexical- semantic con-\ntent must always be traded off— at least to some degree, and often to a large degree—\nagainst the need for cognitive and communicative efficiency. As a result, there is\nimmense variation in how different languages end up classifying the vast multidimen-\nsional realm of human experiences.4\nExamples of idiosyncratic, language-p articular forms of expression are legion\nin the semantic typology literature, and also in the rest of this book, so for present\npurposes just a few provocative illustrations should suffice. Here is an especially ar-\nresting case: Although most languages have a large inventory of verbs, others have a\nmuch smaller stock of them, and this leads to a very peculiar mode of event descrip-\ntion. One such language, namely Kalam (Trans- New Guinea, Papua New Guinea),\nhas only about 130 verb roots, and just 15 of them account for a whopping 89% of all\nverb occurrences in texts (Pawley, 1987, 1993, 2008, 2011). In this extremely unusual\nsystem, complex actions are not encoded by individual, semantically specific verbs,\nbut rather by sequences of generic verbs, as in this rough translation of the English\nverb massage:\nwyk d ap tan d ap yap g\nrub hold come ascend hold come descend do\nTurning to a more predictable kind of lexical- semantic variation, some languages de-\nvelop sizable specialized vocabularies that are devoted to topics of great cultural im-\nportance. This is nicely exemplified by Central Yup’ik (Eskimo- Aleut, Alaska), which\nhas no term corresponding to the English noun boot, but instead has a proliferation of\nterms for particular types of boots, as shown in Table 1.1 (Mithun, 2004). In addition,\nevery language has lots of words with quite distinctive meanings that may seem quite\nmarvelous when one first encounters them. For instance, Mundari (Austro- Asiatic,\nIndia) has a melifluous term, rawadawa, that refers to “the sensation of realizing that\nyou can get away with doing something wicked because no one is there to witness\nit” (Evans, 2010). Wagiman (Gunwingguan, Australia) has a verb (more precisely, a\ncoverb), murr, that means “to walk along in the water looking for something with one’s\nfeet” (Wilson, 1999). Navajo (Athabaskan, Southwestern United States) has separate\nnames, - yá and - áázh, for “walking alone” and “walking in pairs” (Mithun, 2004). And\nZurich German, but not Standard German, has a term, schärme, that denotes “a place\nwhere it does not rain when it rains all around” (Bickel, 2014).\n4 This variation is not, however, completely unlimited, as demonstrated below with regard to color\n(see also Kemp et al., 2018).\n\n8 Concepts in the Brain\nTable 1.1. Central Yup’ik (Eskimo- Aleut, Alaska) lacks a general term\nequivalent to the English noun boot, but it has a large inventory of more\nspecific terms for particular types of boots.\nTerms for Boots Meanings\nnanilnguaraq short skin boot\namirak fishskin boot\nayagcuun thigh- high boot with fur on the outside\ncatquk dyed sealskin boot\nciuqalek fancy dyed sealskin boot with dark fur over the shin\niqertaq sealskin boot with fur inside\nivrarcuun wading boot\nivruciq waterproof skin boot\natallgaq ankle- high skin boot\nkameksak ankle- high skin boot, house slipper\nqaliruaq ankle- high skin boot for dress wear\npiluguk skin boot\nsap’akiq manufactured boot or shoe\nFrom Mithun (2004).\nGiven all this cross-l inguistic diversity, it is natural, of course, to ask whether there\nare any genuinely universal lexical- semantic structures (von Fintel & Matthewson,\n2008). This continues to be a controversial question, but some researchers believe\nthe answer is yes. According to the Natural Semantic Metalanguage research program\nthat Anna Wierzbicka has been directing for over 30 years, all languages do share a\nsmall set of symbolic units that encode the very same basic concepts (e.g., Goddard\n& Wierzbicka, 1994, 2002; Wierzbicka, 1996; Goddard, 2008). These concepts\nare frequently called semantic primes or atoms because their content is putatively\nundecomposable. Approximately 70 such primes have been posited so far, and a large\nproportion of them are lexical- semantic rather than grammatical- semantic in char-\nacter, falling under such headings as substantives (thing, body), relational substantives\n(kind, part), evaluators (good, bad), descriptors (big, small), mental predicates (want,\nthink, know, feel, see, hear), speech (say, words), events (do, happen, move, touch), and\nlife and death (live, die). Even some of these apparently incontrovertible candidates for\nlexical- semantic universals have been challenged, however. For example, Evans (1994,\n2007) argues that there is no counterpart to want in Kayardild (Tangic, Australia)\nand that neither think nor know map straightforwardly onto the mental predicates of\nDalabon (Gunwingguan, Australia).\nLexical- semantic fields\nIn every language, the meanings of most words are defined partly in relation to the\nmeanings of other words, especially those that fall within the same semantic field. For\nexample, Levin (1993) sorted over 3,000 English verbs into approximately 50 classes\nand 200 subclasses. Representative classes include verbs of contact by impact (e.g., tap,\n\n9 The Perspective from Semantic Typology\npoke, pound, swat), verbs of throwing (e.g., toss, fling, hurl, lob), verbs of creation (e.g.,\nbuild, assemble, sculpt, weave), and verbs of ingesting (e.g., eat, chew, gobble, devour).\nThe verbs in a particular class collectively provide a richly detailed categorization of\nthe relevant semantic field by making distinctions, sometimes of a remarkably fine-\ngrained nature, along a number of different parameters. As an illustration, verbs of\ndestruction are distinguished by the composition of the entity to be destroyed (e.g.,\ntear vs. smash), the degree of force (e.g., tear vs. rip), and the extent of deformation\n(e.g., tear vs. shred). In addition, the verbs in a particular class are organized according\nto principled semantic relations such as the following (Fellbaum, 1998): synonymy,\nin which two verbs have nearly identical meanings (e.g., shout and yell); antonymy, in\nwhich two verbs have opposite meanings (e.g., lengthen and shorten); hyponymy, in\nwhich one verb occupies a higher taxonomic level than another (e.g., talk and lecture);\nand cohyponymy, in which two verbs occupy the same taxonomic level (e.g., bow and\ncurtsy). Interestingly, a speaker’s choice of which verb to use in a certain situation may\nhave social repercussions affecting his or her rights, duties, and accountability. For in-\nstance, Enfield (2015a, p. 217) cites a case, originally reported by Sidnell and Barnes\n(2013), in which “two children dispute whether one of them had ‘tapped’ an object\nor ‘poked’ it, with obvious implications for culpability depending on whose version is\naccepted.”\nThe languages of the world display numerous similarities and differences in how\nthey lexically subdivide the same semantic fields, and in recent years an increasing\namount of research has been devoted to documenting the extent of this variation,\nidentifying the factors that drive and constrain it, and determining whether it is sig-\nnificantly greater for some fields than others. Comparative studies involving anywhere\nfrom a handful of languages to well over a hundred have already addressed a wide range\nof domains, including plants and animals (e.g., Berlin, 1992), body parts (e.g., Enfield\net al., 2006), household containers (e.g., Malt et al., 1999), landscapes (e.g., Burenhult\n& Levinson, 2008), colors (e.g., Kay & Maffi, 2005), temperatures (e.g., Koptjevskaja-\nTamm, 2015), odors (Majid & Burenhult, 2014), spatial relations (e.g., Levinson &\nWilkins, 2006a), kinship (e.g., Kemp & Regier, 2012), numbers (e.g., Comrie, 2005),\nemotions (e.g., Wierzbicka, 1999), and several categories of action, such as locomoting\n(e.g., Slobin et al., 2014), giving (e.g., Newman, 1998), reciprocating (e.g., Evans et al.,\n2011), cutting and breaking (e.g., Majid & Bowerman, 2007), putting and taking (e.g.,\nKopecka & Narasimhan, 2012), and eating and drinking (e.g., Newman, 2009). All of\nthese studies, and many others as well, demonstrate that languages differ multifariously\nin their lexical partitioning of the same semantic fields while still tending to exhibit\noverarching patterns. Several studies of some of the fields just mentioned are discussed\nat length in Part II of this volume, together with pertinent neuroscientific findings. To\nget an initial sense here of how such research is conducted, we will briefly consider a\ntopic that is not covered later— namely, the intensively investigated domain of colors.\nColor is a very salient aspect of human visual experience, and the number of shades\nthat people can perceptually distinguish is enormous—a pproximately two million just\nnoticeable differences (JNDs). In semantic typology, one of the oldest issues involves\nthe degree to which languages converge and diverge in their use of basic color terms\nto classify this broad spectrum of sensations. To qualify as a basic color term, a word\nmust be monolexemic and familiar to most speakers, and it must also denote a range\nof colors that is not subsumed within the range of a separate term. Some English words\n\n10 Concepts in the Brain\nthat satisfy these criteria are red, yellow, and purple. Some others that clearly do not\nare forward fuchsia, solaria, and euphoric lilac, which are on the flamboyant list of over\n1,500 paint colors available from Sherwin- Williams. Because the typological literature\non color is quite large, only a small part of it is summarized here, with special emphasis\non some key methods and results.\nBuilding on classic work by Berlin and Kay (1969), Kay et al. (2009) carried out\nthe World Color Survey (WCS), which explored the color lexicons of 110 geograph-\nically and genealogically disparate languages from non-i ndustrialized societies. The\nstimuli consisted of a standardized array of 330 colored chips representing 40 equally\nspaced, maximally saturated Munsell hues at 8 levels of lightness, as well as 10 ach-\nromatic shades extending from white to gray to black (Figure 1.1). In each language\ncommunity, a fieldworker asked speakers (mean n = 24, range = 6– 30) to not only\nname the color of each chip in the grid (a task designed to identify the breadth of each\ncategory), but also indicate which chip best exemplified the meaning of each term (a\ntask designed to identify the prototype or focus of each category).\nThe main results reinforced and extended those from Berlin and Kay’s (1969)\nprevious study. Cross-l inguistically, basic color terms denote three general types of\ncategories: (1) primary color categories, of which there are precisely six—w hite,\nblack, red, yellow, green, and blue; (2) composite color categories, which are fuzzy\nunions of the primaries— e.g., green/ blue, where “/ ” indicates “or”; and (3) derived\ncolor categories, which are mixtures of the primaries— e.g., pink, which is a mixture of\nwhite and red. In addition, color term systems tend to evolve over historical time in a\nmanner that proceeds through a succession of increasingly fine- grained partitions of\nperceptual color space. In fact, of the 110 languages in the WCS, 91 (83%) have sys-\ntems that fall along the central line of development shown in Figure 1.2. For each kind\nof system illustrated in this figure, a representative language is mentioned in Table\n1.2. These findings reveal several interesting aspects of typological variation and uni-\nformity in the lexical encoding of color concepts (see also Haynie & Bowern, 2016).\nFor instance, there are languages that fail to distinguish between red and yellow, and\nthere are also languages that fail to distinguish between green and blue, but as a system\ndevelops, the former contrast always emerges before the latter, and this evolutionary\npattern justifies the following implicational universal: if a language distinguishes be-\ntween green and blue, then it also distinguishes between red and yellow.\nFigure 1.1. The World Color Survey stimulus palette. A color version is in the color plates section.\nFrom Kay & Regier (2003, p. 9086).\n\n11 The Perspective from Semantic Typology\nW\nW\nR\nR\nY\nY\nG\nBk/G/Bu\nBk/Bu\nW\nW\nW R\nW/R/Y W R/Y R Y\nR/Y Y\nBk/G/Bu G/Bu G\nBk/G/Bu G/Bu\nBk Bu\nBk\nBk\nW\nW\nR\nR\nY/G\nY/G/Bu\nBu\nBk\nBk\nI II III IV V\nFigure 1.2. A typological and evolutionary scheme covering most of the 110 languages in\nthe World Color Survey. Letters represent basic color categories according to the following\nconventions: W = White; R = Red; Y = Yellow; Bk = Black; G = Green; Bu = Blue. Composite\ncategories are marked with “/ ”, which means “or.” Each bracketed set of letters represents a type of\ncolor term system, and nine different systems are shown to evolve over five historical stages (marked\nI through V), with the system(s) at each successive stage containing one or more term(s) than at\nthe previous stage, reflecting the progressive differentiation of color space. Derived categories (e.g.,\npink) usually appear after stage V and are not included here because showing all of the possible\ncombinations would lead to pointless complexity.\nFrom Kay et al. (2009, p. 11).\nStatistical analyses of the WCS data have yielded many more insights. Kay and\nRegier (2003) compared the centroids— i.e., the centers of mass of the named sets\nof chips— of all color categories in all 110 languages, and found that they not only\nclustered around certain points in perceptual color space, but did so in a way that\nwas significantly greater than chance (Figure 1.3; see also Lindsey & Brown, 2006).\nTable 1.2.
