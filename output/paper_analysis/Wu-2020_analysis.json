  "full_text": "Taxonomy of Numeral Classifiers:\nA Formal Semantic Proposal\nJiun-Shiung Wu and One-Soon Her\n<abstract>\nIn a numeral classifier language, a classifier (C) or measure word\n(M) is needed to link a noun (N) and its numerical quantifier (Num). This\npaper first illustrates the confusions surrounding the convergence and\ndivergence between Cs and Ms and offers some clarification. From the\nmultiplicative mathematical perspective proposed in Greenberg\n(1990[1972]: 172), Au Yeung (2007), and Her (2012a), C and M converge\nas the multiplicand, with Num as the multiplier. Yet, crucially, a C’s value\nis numerical and necessarily 1, while an M’s value can be anything but 1,\nthus ¬1. An M’s value can therefore be numerical, e.g., 2, 6, 12, etc., or\nnon-numerical, e.g., kilo, meter, liter, bottle, etc. This paper then proposes\na new and comprehensive taxonomy based on the different kinds of\nmathematical values encoded in C/Ms and further proposes a formal\nsemantic account of this taxonomy.\nKeywords: formal semantics, classifier, measure word, multiplicand, 1,\n¬1\n1. Introduction\nIn a numeral classifier language like Chinese, when a noun (N) is quantified by a numeral\n(Num), a classifier (C) or measure word (M) is often needed, as in (1a) and (1b), respectively.\nNote that C and M appear in exactly the same syntactic position and are in complementary\ndistribution, as shown in (2).\n(1) a. san tiao yu\n3 C fish\n‘3 fish’\nb. san xiang yu\n3 M-box fish\n‘3 boxes of fish’\n1\n\n(2) a.*san tiao xiang yu\nb.*san xiang tiao yu\nThis fact suggests that C and M in a classifier language form a single syntactic category,\nwhich we shall dub ‘C/M’. This C/M convergence view is shared by many linguists, e.g.,\nHass (1942), Emeneau (1951), D. Nguyen (1957), Chao (1968), Becker (1975), Li &\nThompson (1981), Huang (1982), Hundias & Kolver (1983), Craig (1994), Lin (1997),\nCheng & Sybesma (1998, 1999), M. Hsieh (2008), among many others, where various\narguments have been constructed to support this view (see Her 2012b for a summary). Most\nstandard dictionaries, grammar books, and language textbooks of classifier languages also do\nnot make any formal distinction between the two. However, as likewise noted by numerous\nlinguists, Cs and Ms are also very different. This following informal characterization by Tai\n& Wang (1990: 38) is an often-cited example:\nA classifier categorizes a class of nouns by picking out some salient perceptual properties,\neither physically or functionally based, which are permanently associated with entities named\nby the class of nouns; a measure word does not categorize but denotes the quantity of the\nentity named by noun. (Tai & Wang 1990: 38)\nThe undeniable fact that Ms quantify the head noun, but Cs must qualify the noun in\nterms of certain semantic features has compelled many researchers to claim that C and M are\ntwo distinct semantic and/or syntactic categories, e.g., Greenberg (1990[1972]), Tai & Wang\n(1990), Tai (1994), Her & Hsieh (2010), X. Li (2011, 2012), Zhang (2011), among many\nothers. T. Nguyen (2004: vii), for example, is emphatic that ‘classifiers and measure phrases,\noften treated as belonging to a single category in prior literature, are shown to be\n2\n\nfundamentally distinct.’ Likewise, various arguments have been constructed to support this\ndivergence view (also see Her 2012b for a summary).\nThe fact that C and M seem to converge and diverge at the same time has long put\nlinguists in a quandary. In practice, most of the syntactic works, especially the more recent\nones in the generative framework, e.g., Tang (2005), M. Hsieh (2008), Huang et al (2009),\nHer (2012b), A. Li (2014), to name just a few, take C and M to be a single category, some\nexplicitly and others implicitly, even though, as H. Zhang (2007:45) observes, ‘Chinese\nlinguists generally agree that a distinction between these two kinds should be made.’ Wang\n(1994: 19-20) complains that ‘previous works in Chinese grammar treat classifiers and\nmeasure words on an equal footing’ and proclaims that ‘it is essential to tell classifiers from\nmeasure words both semantically and syntactically’. N. Zhang (2009) also observes that ‘the\nrelation between classifiers and measure words has baffled linguists for a long time’ and\nsubsequently proposes in (N. Zhang 2011, 2013) that C and M constitute two different\ncategories in both syntactic and semantic terms. Yet, even for those that explicitly claim that\nC and M should be distinguished, the criteria proposed are often informal and imprecise. The\nquote from Tai & Wang (1990: 38) given above is a good example.\nAn added confusion in this already confused state of affairs is the issue whether classifier\nlanguages like Chinese make a lexical distinction of mass and count. While many, e.g., Cheng\n& Sybesma (1998), Tang (2005), M. Hsieh (2008), Her & Hsieh (2010), Yi (2009, 2011), Her\n(2012a), among others, assume such a distinction in Chinese and contend that C requires a\nlexical count noun but M does not, many others, e.g., Quine (1969), Allan (1977), Hanson\n(1983), Link (1991), Lucy (1992), Krifka (1995), Chierchia (1998a), Mou (1999), Toyota\n(2009), and Toyota et al (2012), insist that the fact that C/M is required for Num to quantify\nN means that N can only be mass in such languages.\n3\n\nIn this paper we aim to accomplish three things. First, we will follow Her (2012a) in\ninterpreting the convergence and divergence between Cs and Ms from a mathematical\nperspective and further argue that C/M as a single syntactic category can be classified into\ndifferent subtypes in terms of their mathematical values. Thus, Her and Lin’s (2015) formal\ntaxonomy of various subtypes under C/M will be discussed and supported. Second, we shall\noffer a formal semantic account for the C/M unification as well as the various types in the\nC/M taxonomy. Third, we will demonstrate that in carrying out the above two goals it is\nnecessary to assume a lexical mass/count distinction in classifier languages. This position\nthen leads to the conclusion that such a distinction is universal.\nThe paper is organized into six sections. Section 2 offers a brief description of the current\nconfused state of affairs in the study of Cs and Ms and provides some clarification. Section 3\nfirst reviews the similarities and difference between Cs and Ms, and then accounts for such\nconvergence and divergence with a new taxonomy of C/Ms based on an insight from a\nmathematical perspective, where C/Ms are viewed as multiplicands with various kinds of\nvalues. Section 4 proposes a formal semantic account of Cs and various subtypes of Ms.\nSection 5 demonstrates that the taxonomy and the semantics proposed in this paper are\nevidence for a universal mass/count distinction at the lexical level. Section 6 consists of a\nsummary and some concluding remarks.\n2. A Confused State of Affairs\nAs noted by some researchers, e.g., H. Zhang (2007: 45) and Her (2012a: 1669), the\nuncertain status of Cs and Ms is reflected in the often confusing terminology used in the\nliterature. Terms used for C include ‘classifier’, ‘count-classifier’, ‘count-noun classifier’,\n‘individual classifier’, ‘qualifying classifier’, and ‘sortal classifier’; those for M include\n‘measure word’, ‘mass-classifier’, ‘mass-noun classifier’, ‘massifier’, ‘mensural classifier’,\n4\n\n‘measural classifier’, and ‘quantifier’. This list is not meant to be exhaustive. Further to the\nconfusion, many also use the term ‘classifier’, ‘numeral classifier’, or ‘quantifier’ for C/M as\na single category, and some others use the term ‘measure word’, ‘measure’, ‘unit word’, or\n‘numerative’ instead for the same purpose. Most of the papers or books published in Chinese\nuse the term 量詞liangci ‘measure word’ to refer to the category of C/M, while a small\nnumber of them do clearly distinguish between 分類詞 fenleici or 類別詞 leibieci\n‘classifier’ and liangci ‘measure word’. In this paper we use the term ‘C/M’ to refer to the\nunified category of the elements between Num and N; the construction is referred to as [Num\nC/M N]. ‘C’ is strictly for ‘classifiers’ (or ‘sortal classifiers’) and ‘M’ strictly for ‘measure\nwords’ (or ‘mensural classifiers’ or ‘massifiers’). Explicit criteria for this distinction will be\ndiscussed in section 3.\nAnother symptom of the confused state of affairs, as noted by Her & Hsieh (2012: 128),\nis the drastically different inventories of ‘classifiers’, or linagci, compiled by different\nresearchers for Mandarin Chinese, ranging from as few as fifty-one (Chao 1968) and several\ndozen (Erbaugh 2002), to one hundred and twenty-six (Gao & Malt 2009), to two hundred\n(Hung 1996), to four hundred and twenty-seven (Huang & Ahrens 2003), to as many as many\nas six hundred (Hu 1993). These different numbers no doubt reflect very different ideas as to\nwhat belongs to this category, and even for those that do make a clear distinction between Cs\nand Ms, there is confusion over what counts as a C exactly. To the best of our knowledge, Lai\n(2011) and Her & Lai (2012) on Mandarin, Chen (2013) and Chen et al (to appear) on\nTaiwanese southern Min, and Liao (2014) on Taiwanese Hakka are the only three works in\nthe literature that offer a comprehensive list of Cs in a classifier language that is based on\nexplicit and testable criteria.\nThe problem is thus two-fold: how to precisely and insightfully distinguish C and M and\nyet also unify C/M at the same time. Previous accounts fall short one way or another.\n5\n\nAccounts that treat C and M as one formal category typically lack precise or formal\ndistinction between the two subcategories, e.g., Hsieh (2008), Huang et al (2009), A. Li\n(2014), to name just a few. Li & Thompson (1981: 106) famously claim that ‘any measure\nword can be a classifier.’ On the other hand, in works that do offer a distinction between C\nand M, the distinction is typically stated informally and there is also a lack of account for C\nand M’s formal convergence. Examples abound; here we discuss several examples from\nprominent works, starting with a classic, Chao (1968: 584-620), where Cs are referred to as\n‘classifiers’, ‘individual measures’, or ‘Mc’ in short, and considered one out of eight types\nwithin the category of nominal measure words.1\n(3) Chao’s (1968:584-620) Classification of Measure Words\n1. Mc (Classifiers, or Individual Measures):\ne.g., 一個人 yige ren ( 1 C person) ‘one person’\n2. Mc’ (Classifiers Associated with V-O):\ne.g., 惹一場禍 re yichang huo (cause 1 C disaster) ‘cause a disaster’\n3. Mg (Group Measures):\ne.g., 一行字 yihang zi (1 line character) ‘one line of characters’\n4. Mp (Partitive Measures):\ne.g., 一堆土 yidui tu (1 pile dirt) ‘one pile of dirt’\n5. Mo (Container Measures):\ne.g., 一鍋麵 yiguo mian (1 pot noodle) ‘one pot of noodles’\n6. Mt (Temporary Measures):\ne.g., 一頭百髮 yitou baifa (1 head white-hair) ‘a headful of white hairs’\n7. Mm (Standard Measures):\n6\n\ne.g., 一尺布 yichi bu ‘one meter of cloth’\n8. Mq (Quasi-Measures, or Autonomous Measures):\ne.g., 一釐 yili or 一趴 yipa ‘one percent’\nThe fundamental disadvantage associated with this taxonomy is that the eight types are all\ndisjoint and allow no intersecting natural classes. For example, a group measure, a container\nmeasure, and a quasi-measure that has a standardized value, e.g., 打 da ‘dozen’, 茶匙\nchichi ‘teaspoon’, and釐 li ‘%’, respectively, can of course also be seen as a standard\nmeasure. Further, any measure word of any type currently without a standardized value can\neasily take on a standardized value, be it permanently or temporally, among a small\npopulation or a large population, and thus become a standard measure. The fact that the\ndifferent types intersect means that having them as disjoint misses the essential purpose of\ntaxonomy.\nThe same weakness is seen in Aikhenvald (2000: 115-117), a seminal work on classifiers,\nwhere she distinguishes between ‘(numeral) classifiers’ (a term for both ‘sortal classifiers’\nand ‘measural classifiers’) and ‘measure words’ (a term exchangeable with ‘quantifiers’ and\n‘quantifying expressions’) in classifier languages, based on the observation that classifiers\nuse the unit provided by a noun, while quantifiers, or quantifying expressions, establish the\nunit to be counted. Under her view, ‘classifiers’, ‘sortal’ and ‘mensural’, must co-occur with\ncount nouns, while ‘measure words’ appear with count or mass nouns. Consider the examples\nin (4).\n(4) san zhi/shuang/xiang/jin xie\n3 C/M-pair/M-box/M-kilo shoe\n‘3 shoes/3 pairs/boxes/kilos of shoes’\n7\n\nIn spite of their identical syntactic position, zhi ‘C’, shuang ‘pair’, xiang ‘box’, and jin\n‘kilo’ are seen as a sortal classifier, mensural classifier, quantifier, and quantifier, respectively.\nThe former two are ‘classifiers’, but the latter two are excluded. Such exclusion misses\nimportant generalizations of C/M as a single category and is also in conflict with the view\nshared by most grammarians, that shuang ‘pair’, xiang ‘box’, and jin ‘kilo’ are all Ms, or\nmensural classifiers.\nS. Huang (2013), an important recent work on Chinese grammar, where an entire chapter\nis devoted to numeral classifiers, claims to follow Aikhenvald’s (2000) distinction of ‘sortal’\nand ‘mensural’ classifiers; furthermore, his distinction is also essentially the same as that of\nTai & Wang (1990: 38):\nIn the following discussion we will ignore Chao's types (7) and (8), since they do not represent\nwhat I take to be true classifiers in the strict sense of the term. I will for the time being\ndistinguish just two basic types of NC for nominal classifiers, more or less following\nAikhenvald (2000), sortal classifiers and mensural classifiers. A sortal classifier is one which\nindividuates a referent in terms of its more inherent properties such as animacy, shape, or\nconsistency. Mensural classifiers are used for measuring more temporary state of an object, its\nquantity, or the arrangement it occurs in. …Note that sortal classifiers and mensural classifiers\nare to be distinguished from ordinary measure words such as jin (斤) in yijin tang. (S. Huang\n2013: 167-168)\nS. Huang’s (2013) rejection of Chao’s type 7, or standard measures like jin ‘catty, kilo’\nand 尺 chi ‘meter’, as mensural classifiers is puzzling. Standard measures after all occupy\nexactly the same syntactic position as other C/Ms, e.g., zhi ‘C’, shuang ‘pair’, and xiang ‘box’\nin (4), and serve the same function to measure the noun. The exclusion of Chao’s type 8, i.e.,\n8\n\nquasi-measures, is also unnecessary, as these are simply standard measures of portion that\noften appear without a head noun.\nThe final taxonomy we shall briefly review is found in N. Zhang (2013), where seven\ntypes of ‘unit words’, or C/Ms in our term, are recognized: individual (e.g., 枝 zhi),\nindividuating (e.g., 滴 di), kind (e.g., 種 zhong), container (e.g., 瓶 ping), standard (e.g.,\n斤 jin), partitive (e.g., 段 duan), and collective (e.g., 群 qun). In spite of the apparent\nresemblance with Chao’s taxonomy, there are several noteworthy differences. First, N. Zhang\nrightly ignores Chao’s type 2, classifiers associated with V-O, as such classifiers easily\nappear in non-object positions, and Chao’s type 8, quasi-measures, which, as shown earlier,\ncan be seen as standard measures. Second, N. Zhang (2013: 212) contends that Chao’s type 6,\nor temporary measures, can be seen as container measures or nouns. Third, N. Zhang includes\nkind classifiers as a separate type, which is rather reasonable. The fourth difference is more\nimportant: Chao’s type 4, partitive measures, is divided into two types, partitive and\nindividuating. An individuating unit word must select nouns that are not delimitable, but a\npartitive unit word can select either delimitable or undelimitable nouns. A delimitable noun is\natomic, while an undelimitable noun has no intrinsic shape, size, or boundaries.\nNote that N. Zhang makes an extraordinary, and likely to be controversial, claim that\ncontainer, standard, partitive, and collective unit words have a left-branching structure, but\nindividual, individuating, and kind unit words have a right-branching structure. The seven\ntypes thus in effect form two formally distinct categories, as shown in Table 1.\nTable 1. Taxonomy of C/Ms Derived from Zhang (2013)\n9\n\nCategory Type Examples\nContainer 瓶 ping, 箱 xiang\nMeasures Standard 斤jin, 尺 chi\n(left-branching) Partitive 段 duan, 節 jie\nCollective 群 qun, 打 da\nIndividual 枝 zhi, 朵 duo\nClassifiers\nIndividuating 滴 di, 灘 tan\n(right-branching)\nKind 種 zhong, 類 lei\nThis dichotomy has serious implications. Assigning the individual Cs and the\nindividuating Cs to the same category is inconsistent with the fact that the former requires\ndelimitable nouns and the latter, undelimitable nouns. On the other hand, assigning the\nindividual Cs and collective Ms to two different categories misses the generalization that they\nboth require delimitable nouns. More importantly, this dichotomy predicts that the\nleft-branching measures and right-branching classifiers need not follow the same word order\nin a language. We should thus expect to find that the two distinct categories deviate in word\norder in some languages. Yet, Greenberg (1990[1975]: 228) claims that Cs and Ms do not\ndeviate in word order in any classifier language. In an ongoing research project headed by the\nfirst author, in a database of over 500 classifier languages, no evidence is found that Cs and\nMs differ in word order in any of them. In addition, in all these languages, in a nominal\nphrase that consists of a Num and an N, either a C or an M is used, never both. C and M are\nalways in complimentary distribution. These facts are disconfirming to N. Zhang’s\ndichotomy, and suggest strongly that C and M belong to the same category and occupy the\nsame structural position.2\n10\n\nLast but not the least, it is crucial to distinguish between the formal syntactic category of\nC/M, as defined by the construction [Num C/M N], and the function they serve, for there is\nunfortunately a prevailing confusion over whether certain types of Cs or Ms are in fact\nuniversally available in all languages. The simple fact is that classifier languages like Chinese\nemploy C/M as a syntactic category, while non-classifier languages like English have the\nfunctional equivalent of such words but do not distinguish a C/M category formally. Many\nlinguists make the misleading claim that measure words, or mass-classifiers, are a mundane\npart of all natural languages, and only sortal classifiers, or count-classifiers, are unique to\nclassifier languages like Chinese and Japanese, and are not a part of English grammar except\nin rare cases such as five head of lettuce (e.g., Allan 1977: 285-86, Croft 1994: 151-152, Tai\n1994: 481, Wang 1994: 1, Aikhenvald 2000: 115, Her & Hsieh 2010: 528, among many\nothers). N. Zhang (2013: 246) and Croft (1994: 151-152) claim specifically that standard\nmeasures (e.g., kilo in five kilos of apples), container measures (e.g., bottle in three bottles of\nmilk), kind CL (kind in three kinds of chocolate), partitive CLs (e.g., section in three sections\nof orange), and collective CLs (e.g., group in three groups of students) are universally\navailable, but individuating CLs and individual CLs exist only in classifier languages. Such a\nview seriously confuses function with form. Worse still is Toyota’s (2009: 120) use of the\nterm classifier in his claim that English has numerous classifiers. In the quote below, PDE\nstands for Present-day English.3\nThe use of classifiers with the mass noun is quite common in PDE, as in a piece of furniture,\nan item of clothing, etc. There may be numerous classifies in PDE, but typical examples used\nfor the analysis in this paper are listed in (5).\n(5) an article of clothing; a blade of grass; a block of ice; a bit of information; a bunch of\ngrapes; a cake of soap; a cut of meat; a drop of water; an ear of corn; a grain of corn; an\nitem of clothing; a leaf of sage; a loaf of bread; a lot of water; a piece of information; a\n11\n\nsheet of paper; a slice of bacon; a speck of dust; a stick of chalk; a strip of land; a suit of\nclothing\n(Toyota 2009: 120)\nNone of the words of measure in the above quote is the Chinese-style M, nor C. In a\nnon-classifier language, there can of course be words of measure, e.g., kilo, bottle, section,\ngroup, etc. in English, which have the semantic function identical to that of Ms in a classifier\nlanguage, e.g., the corresponding jin, ping, jie, qun, etc. in Chinese (e.g., Lyons 1977: 464,\nCroft 1994: 152, Löbel 2000: 223). However, formally since there is no (overt) structural\nposition for C in English or other non-classifier languages, there can be no such position for\nM.4 There can thus be no Ms in English, not in the same formal sense as in Chinese or other\nclassifier languages. Words of measure in English in fact behave as Ns, and nothing like Ms\nin Chinese (e.g., Lehrer 1986; Van Riemsdijk 1998; Aikhenvald 2000; Löbel 2000; Borer\n2005; Kayne 2005a). As shown in (5), the word of measure box must pluralize like a noun\nand its complement must be introduced by a PP, not a bare NP. Its syntactic category and\nstructural position in (5) are exactly identical to those in (6) and (7), where box behaves as a\nmundane common noun.\n(5) a. three boxes of chocolate\nb.*three box of chocolate\nc.*three boxes chocolate\n(6) a. three boxes of excellent quality\nb.*three box of excellent quality\nc.*three boxes excellent quality\n(7) a. three boxes of theirs\nb.*three box of theirs\n12\n\nc.*three boxes theirs\nIn short, while a classifier language typically has both Cs and Ms,5 a non-classier\nlanguage has neither, though it does have a class of words that share the same semantic\nfunction as Ms in classifier languages.\n3. A Math-based Taxonomy of C/M\nAny characterization of C and M must reconcile the dilemma that the two converge\nstructurally in [Num C/M N] and yet diverge semantically. A long-neglected mathematical\nperspective offers a unique insight to the relation between Num and C/M as well as the\nprecise distinction between C and M. The earliest source of such a view we know of is\nGreenberg (1990[1972]: 172), where he states with unmistakable clarity that “all the\nclassifiers are from the referential point of view merely so many ways of saying ‘one’, or\nmore accurately, ‘times one’.” Thus, san tiao yu [three C fish] of (1a) is seen as [[3 × 1] fish].\nSeeing sortal classifiers as a multiplicand with the numerical value of ‘one’ implicates\nthe entity being quantified must have natural boundaries and thus appear as single units\n(Croft 1994: 148, Bisang 1999: 113-121). This view has been pursued in some of the more\nrecent works, e.g., Bender & Beller (2006), Au Yeung (2005, 2007), and Yi (2009). Her\n(2012a) takes this view most seriously in coming up with a precise formulation for the\nunification of, and distinction between, C and M.\n(8) C/M Distinction in Mathematical Terms (Her 2012a:1679)\n[Num X N] = [[Num × X] N], where X = C iff X =1, otherwise X = M.\n13\n\nUnder this precise formulation, C and M converge in entering the same multiplicative\nrelation as the multiplicand, with Num as the multiplier. Thus, crucially, while Cs and Ms\nconverge in denoting one unit, the one unit denoted by Cs has the precise numerical value of\none, but the one unit denoted by Ms does not, e.g., da ‘dozen’ denotes the precise numerical\nvalue of twelve. C/M as a multiplicand denoting one unit thus is naturally identically coded\nstructurally in a language. This convergence explains why C/M consists of a single syntactic\ncategory and in many respects behaves in a uniform manner. Yet, C and M also diverge in\ntheir respective value: all Cs as the multiplicand must necessarily have the exact numerical\nvalue 1, while an M’s value can be anything except 1 and can thus be numerical or\nnon-numerical. More simply, an M’s value is never necessarily 1. This divergence in\nmathematical value accounts for the semantic differences, and consequent behavioral\ndifferences, observed between Cs and Ms.\nThe most significant difference is M is semantically substantive but C is semantically\nredundant, in the sense that M does, but C does not, contribute additional information to the\nhead noun (e.g., Greenberg 1990[1974]: 201, W. Li 2000: 1117). Her & Hsieh (2010)\nemploys Aristotle’s essential vs. accidental property to C/M’s semantic distinction:6 while a\nC denotes one or more essential properties of the head noun, an M denotes accidental\nproperties. This means that a C is semantically redundant in the nominal expression, but an M\nis not. For example, the following three expressions, 三隻魚san zhi yu, 三條魚san tiao yu,\nand 三尾魚san wei yu, have exactly the same truth condition, i.e., 3 fish, in spite of the\ndifferent Cs; yet, if the three different Cs are replaced with three different Ms, then each\nexpression will have different truth condition, e.g., 三磅魚san bang yu ‘3 pounds of fish’,\n三箱魚san xiang yu ‘3 boxes of fish’, and 三籃魚 san lan yu ‘3 baskets of fish’.\nThis difference between C and M also receives a plausible explanation in the\nmultiplicative theory: a multiplicand in a multiplicative relation is redundant if and only if its\n14\n\nvalue is 1; a C is thus redundant in a nominal expression, but M is not (Her 2012a). Such\nredundancy also manifests itself in Cs’ being transparent to adjectival modification. Thus, (9a)\nand (9b) have the same meaning, but (10a) and (10b) do not.\n(9) a. 一大顆蘋果 = b. 一顆大蘋果 (Her & Hsieh 2010 (13a))\nyi da ke pingguo = yi ke da pingguo\none big C apple one C big apple\n‘one big apple’ ‘one big apple’\n(10) a. 一大箱蘋果 ≠ b. 一箱大蘋果 (Her & Hsieh 2010 (13a))\nyi da xiang pingguo ≠ yi xiang da pingguo\none big M-box apple one M-box big apple\n‘one big box of apples’ ‘one box of big apples’\nNote that an M can of course be represented redundantly as 1M; however, crucially, the\nvalue of 1M is entirely different from the numerical value of any C, which is exactly 1. For\nexample, san da [3×dozen] can be expressed redundantly as [3×1dozen]; however, both\nexpressions are different from [3×1]. Such a misunderstanding is found in N. Zhang (2013:\n37), where she claims that Greenberg’s ‘times one’ interpretation of all Cs is true of all\nmeasure words as well:\nGreenberg (1972: 10) points out that “all the classifiers are from the referential point of view\nmerely so many ways of saying ... ‘times one’.” This is also true of all measure words. All\ntypes of CLs and measure words are used in counting, telling us what counts as one in the\ncontext, i.e., the unit of counting (see Croft 1994: 152 and Allan 1977: 293). N. Zhang (2013:\n37)\n15\n\nImportantly, in Greenberg’s works on numeral classifiers, e.g., Greenberg (1972, 1974,\n1975), he has consistently made the distinction between the classifier construction and the\nmeasure construction. It is thus clear that Greenberg only intends for the ‘times one’\ninterpretation to apply to Cs, not Ms. In fact, in the same passage, Greenberg (1990[1972]:\n172) further applies multiplication to two instances of measure words, two dozen and twelve\npairs, and acknowledges that their ‘identity of final numerical result’, which is unmistakably\n36, is drastically different from the result of [2×1] or [12×1]. C/Ms are indeed all units of\ncounting, but the crucial difference between C and M is their inherent mathematical value.\nThere is thus another caveat to heed: the actual value of an M may accidentally be\nprecisely 1, but that is not the same as necessarily 1. For example, san bang yu ‘three pounds\nof fish’ may just happen to be exactly three fish, each weighing exactly one pound. This sheer\naccident does not make pound a C, not even temporally. However precise or imprecise the\nvalue of an M, be it number, weight, volume, size, time, height, length, or monetary value,\nthe crucial point is that as a multiplicand its mathematical value is not necessarily 1. The\nvalue of a C is necessarily 1, but it can also have an accidental non-numerical value. For\nexample, san tiao yu ‘3 fish’ may just happen to be exactly three pounds of fish, again each\nweighing exactly one pound. This sheer accident likewise does not make tiao an M, not even\ntemporally.\nC thus acknowledges a single unit of an entity with natural boundaries, whereas M creates\nboundaries for an entity which may or may not have natural boundaries. Some Ms thus also\nencode numerical values, e.g., 2, 12, or a vague number, and create boundaries for entities\nwith natural boundaries only. Other Ms thus encode non-numerical values and create\nboundaries for all entities. Her & Lin (2015) thus put forth the innovative concept that a\n16\n\ninsightful taxonomy of C/M types can be achieved according to the different types of\nmathematical values encoded by C/M, as shown in Table 1.\nTable 1. Types of C/M Based on Mathematical Value\nNumerical Fixed or C/M\nExamples\nor Not Not Type\n1 個ge, 隻zhi, 條tiao, 本ben, 朵duo C\nFixed\nNumerical ¬1 2雙shuang, 對dui; 6手shou; 12打da M\n1\nVariable >1 (¬1) 排pai ‘row, 群qun ‘group, 幫bang ‘gang’ M\n2\nNon- Fixed ¬n (¬1) 斤 jin ‘catty’, 升sheng ‘liter’, 碼ma ‘yard’ M 3\nnumerical Variable ¬n (¬1) 滴di ‘drop’, 節jie ‘section’, 杯bei ‘cup’ M\n4\nThe two most important criteria for this classification scheme are: first, whether the value\nis exactly 1 or not, and second, whether the underlying mathematical value of a C/M as a\nmultiplicand is numerical or not. The first criterion is crucial because a multiplicand is\nredundant only when its value is 1; this unique property sets Cs apart with Ms. The second\ncriterion is crucial because C/Ms with a numerical value must select nouns that are\ndelimitable, or atomic, thus countable, while those with a non-numerical value can appear\nwith either delimitable or undelimitable nouns. Non-numerical measure words thus come in\nvarious subtypes, e.g., volume, container, weight, length, area, time, money, portion, etc.\nAny C/M with a fixed or standardized value can be seen as standard, thus including C, M ,\n1\nand M . It is thus possible for a C/M to be crossed-listed, if its value is ambiguous, e.g., 茶匙\n3\nchachi ‘teaspoon’ in Chinese can be used as a formal standard measure in cookbooks as well\nas a causal container elsewhere without a fixed value. It is thus possible for a container\nmeasure to be M , if its value is numerically fixed, e.g., the container measure 籠 long\n1\n‘steamer, cage’, when referring to the small steamed pork buns in a Chinese restaurant\n17\n\nspecialized in the northern cuisine, has a standardized value of 10. However, elsewhere it is\nan M or less commonly M , with a numerical or non-numerical but variable value. The\n2 4\nso-called partitive measure, and also what Zhang (2013) calls ‘individuating’ unit words, are\nnow part of M and M , depending on whether the value is fixed, e.g., 半 ban ‘half’, or\n3 4\nvariable, e.g., 節 jie ‘section’. A collective measure is now part of M and M , again\n1 2\ndepending on whether its value is fixed, e.g., 打 da ‘dozen’, or variable, e.g., 群 qun\n‘group, herd’.\nSome linguists also consider event classifiers, e.g., 場 chang, a separate type among\nC/Ms. For example, Huang & Ahrens (2003) distinguish three types: individual, event, and\nkind. However, an event, by definition, is delimitable and must have a beginning and an end.\nEvent classifiers are thus merely a subtype of Cs (Lai 2011, Her & Lai 2013). Finally, we\ntreat the kind unit words, e.g., 種zhong, 類lei, 樣yang, 式 shi, as measure words, more\nspecifically as a subtype of the non-numerical M . This classification is confirmed by a\n4\nprocess of elimination. A kind unit word is not restricted to delimitable nouns, which means it\ncan only be an M or M . Given that what constitutes as a kind is hardly standardized or fixed,\n3 4\nit cannot be an M3. The C/M taxonomy thus offers comprehensive coverage of all the\nelements that appear as C/M in the constituent formed by Num, C/M, and N.\n4. A Formal Semantic Account\nIn this section, we shall first briefly review several important accounts of formal\nsemantics, Chierchia (1998a, 1998b), Krikfa (1995), Jiang (2012), X. Li (2011) and Rothstein\n(2010), and demonstrate that they cannot model the semantic distinction between C and M\nargued for in Section 3, before we propose our own formal semantic account.\n4.1 Review of previous accounts\n18\n\nThe semantics of a C/M is closely related to that of the head noun, as a fundamental\ncriterion on identifying different types of C/M is the semantics of the nouns they select. Since\nChinese nouns are not marked for plurality, there are two potential theoretical hypotheses for\nthe semantics of Chinese nouns. The first is that Chinese nouns denote kind, referred to as\n‘kind analysis’ in this paper, e.g. Chierchi (1998a), Krifka (1995), etc., and the other is that\nChinese nouns denote mass, i.e. the famous mass noun hypothesis, e.g. Chierchia (1998b),\nHansen (1976), and so on.\nWe start from the kind analysis. Charlson (1980), observing that bare plurals in English\ncan denote kind, proposes that kind is a (special type of) individual, which is distinguished\nfrom an individual described a singular count noun, and that kind can be mapped to object\n(i.e. individual), which, in turn, can be mapped to stage (Carlson 1980: 69). McNally (2017)\nlooks into the semantics of kind from another perspective, based on the idea that common\nnouns denote distributional representations. However, McNally also proposes a type shifter\nKO’ to achieve the same purpose of mapping kind to an object.\nThere is another type of research on the semantics of nouns that seems relevant here.\nGrimm (2012) examines nouns in languages such as Welsh or Maltese, and describes a third\ndistinction among nouns, in addition to singular/plural and count/mass, i.e., collective/entity.\nNouns in these languages thus have singular and plural morphological markings, demonstrate\nthe count-mass distinction, and also denote collectivity and entity as well. Morphologically,\ncollective nouns are not marked, but they are marked when denoting an entity of that\ncollective (Grimm 2012:53). Grimm (2012: 68) proposes a hierarchy of individualization:\nsubstances < granular aggregates < collectives < individual entities, and suggests that the\ngrammatical number system for nouns relies on different parts of the hierarchy, e.g.\nlanguages that have a collective/entity distinction use the middle part of the hierarchy.\nChierchia (1998a: 354) explicitly propose that nouns denote kind in Chinese. Chierchia\n19\n\nbases his idea on the fact that a bare noun can appear in an argument position in Chinese. A\nconstituent that can appear in an argument position must be of type e. If Chinese nouns were\nof type <e, t>, like English count nouns, then it would be difficult to explain why a\nconstituent of type <e, t> can appear in a position where a constituent of type e is required.\nAlthough not providing formal details, Chierchia (ibid) identifies as one of the distinctive\nfeatures for languages whose nouns are of type e that such languages utilize classifiers.\nIf Chinese nouns denote kind, then some device is required to map kind to countable\nobjects, that is, individuals, so that such nouns can be quantitized. Krikfa (1995) proposes\nthat classifiers performs type-shifting, in a sense similar to Carlson (1980) and McNally\n(2017), and maps a kind to countable objects. For example, xiong ‘bear’ is a name referring to\nkind, i.e., Ursus, and the other usages, including san zhi xiong [three C bear], are derived\nfrom the kind reading. To account for the [Num C/M N] construction, Krifka proposes an\noperator that takes a noun denoting a kind and returns the number of specimens of that kind.\nSee the example below.\n(11) a. zhi = nyix[RT(x, y)  OU(y)(x) = n]\ni i\nb. san zhi = yix[RT(x, y)  OU(y)(x) = 3]\ni i\nc. san zhi xiong = ix[RT(x, Ursus)  OU(Ursus)(x) = n]\ni i\n(Krifka 1995: 401)\nIn (11), RT applies to a kind and gives us the property of being a specimen or a\nsubspecies of the kind. OU, object unit, is a function that takes a noun expressing a kind and\ngives back the number of the specimens of that kind. The subscripted i represents a possible\nworld. The number san ‘three’ instantiates the n argument of the classifier zhi, that is, OU\nspecifies that the number of the specimens of a kind is three. The semantics of xiong is Ursus,\n20\n\na kind, instantiates the y argument in the semantics of san zhi ‘three C’. Therefore, the\nsemantics of san zhi xiong ‘three CL Ursus’ is: RT maps the kind, Ursus, to specimens, OU\ncounts the specimens of the kind Ursus, and the number of the specimens is three.\nFor san qun xiong [three herd Ursus], Krifka analyzes qun as a counterpart of English\nherd and its semantics is: nyix[RT(x, y)  herd(x) = n]. For san zhong xiong ‘three kind\ni i\nUrsus’, the semantics of zhong is nyix[RT(x, y)  KU(y)(x) = n]. As can be seen from\ni i\nthe semantics of zhi and qun, the difference is that qun does not require an OU operator\nbecause its core semantics is herd. On the other hand, the semantic difference between zhi\nand zhong is that the former takes an OU operator, which returns the number of specimens of\na kind, while the latter has a KU (kind unit) operator, which gives back the number of kind.\nThe kind analysis of nouns cannot apply to Chinese nouns for two reasons.7 First, under\nKrikfa’s (1995) idea that a classifier serves as a type shifter that maps a kind to an individual,\na noun without a classifier should receive a kind reading. While Chierchia (1998a) does not\ndiscuss the function of classifiers, in this paper Chinese nouns are proposed to express kind.\nBut, standing alone without a classifier, a Chinese noun does not (necessarily) express kind.\nFor example, the phrase wu bing er yu (five loaf two fish), gets an individual reading\nonly, .i.e. five loaves and two fish. In examples without a numeral, such as shu, wo dou\nnianwan le ‘book, I all read-finish Pfv’, shu ‘book’ here does not refer to kind as well since it\nis impossible to finish reading books as a kind.\nSecond, it is unclear how exactly type shifter can pick out a coherent individual from a\nkind. While it seems natural to think of a kind as consisting of individuals, Carlson’s (1980)\ntheory treats kind as a type of individual. Then, the question is how the type shifter can\nidentify a discrete, natural or man-made unit from a kind, e.g., a banana, a car, and a trillion.\nThis question has not been addressed in works that support the kind-to-individual theory.8 To\nresolve this problem, one may think of Grimm’s (2012: 134) definition of ‘wholes’, “any two\n21\n\nparts that make up the whole of x [that thing] are connected to each other.” Yet, this definition\nis too restrictive for classifiers in Chinese. For example, in this phrase yi ben zhilipuosui de\nshu ‘one C in-tatters book’, the classifier and zhilipuosui ‘in tatters’ are still compatible. Such\nexamples suggest that Grimm’s definition of wholes cannot be applied to Chinese classifiers.\nHence, the second problem remains.\nOn the other hand, Chierchia (2010) suggests that classifiers, which are of type <k, <e,\nt>>, are needed to type shift kind (of type k) to type <e, t> so that numbers, which are of type\n<<e, t>, <e, t>>, can go with such a noun. He (1998a 349) further proposes that kind is a\nfunction from worlds w to pluralities. Chierchia (1998b, 2010) suggests that the semantics of\na plural is the set of all the atoms and of all the possible sum individuals of the atoms and that\nthe semantics of mass equals that of plurals, except for that the boundaries among the atoms\nfor mass is vague. Chierchia (1998b: 74) further suggests that classifiers map a mass noun to\natoms. Therefore, while technically a classifier can shift the semantic type of a kind (or mass),\nit is not clear how the vague boundaries of atoms for a mass noun can be made distinctive so\nthat individual atoms can be separated from each other. That is, even with Chierchia’s (1998a,\n1998b, 2010) ideas, the second problem is still effective.\nNext, let’s look at the mass noun hypothesis. Hansen (1976) suggests that Chinese nouns\nare mass. Chierchia (1998b) also has a similar proposal.9 As pointed out above, Chierchia\n(1998b, 2010) proposes that the semantics of a plural is the set of all the atoms and all the\nsum individual of the atoms and that the semantics of a mass noun is like that of a plural,\nexcept for that the boundaries between the atoms for a mass noun is vague. Rothstein (2010),\non the other hand, proposes the following semantics for mass nouns, count singular nouns,\nand count plural nouns, based on a complete atomic Boolean algebra M:\n22\n\n(12) a. Root nouns: N  M: Root nouns denote a Boolean algebra of mass entities, the\nroot\nclosure of a set of atoms in M under the sum operations .\nM\nb. Mass nouns: N = N\nmass root\nc. Singular count nouns: COUNT (N ): A singular count noun denotes a set of ordered\nk root\npairs of which the first projection is N  k, a subset of N whose members do not\nroot root\n(generally) overlap, and the second projection is the context k.\nd. Plural count nouns: in a default context k, PL(N )  M  {k}, where the first\nk\nprojection is the closure of N  k under sum, and the second project is k.\nroot\nCOUNT takes the root noun meaning and gives back entities which, in the given\nk\ncontext k, are qualified as atoms and thus can be counted. Based on the semantics in (12),\nRothstein also assumes that C/Ms in Chinese are the overt realization of the COUNT\nk\noperator, which applies to the root meaning (= the mass meaning) of a noun.\nX. Li’s (2011) formal semantic analysis of C/Ms is based on Rothstein’s (2010) idea. He\nfirst distinguishes four types: (i) counting classifiers, which identify the natural counting unit\ninherent to sets of discrete entities, (ii) classifiers with a measuring reading, which “simply\nmeasure the quantity of entities along a certain dimension, e.g. weight, length,” (X. Li 2011:\n126) (iii) classifiers with both counting and measuring readings, and (iv) kind classifiers.\nNote that X. Li uses the term ‘classifiers’ for all C/Ms. He also assumes that Chinese nouns\nare mass. The semantics of the four types are shown in(13), and the semantics of numbers, in\n(14):\n(13) a. duo = kx. (x)( kk)Blossom-form( (x)) (x) = k\n1 1 2\nb. ping = kx. (x)(BOTTLEk)CONTAIN( (x), k) (x)=k\n1 1 2\nc. jin = nkx.xk  POUND(x) = n\n23\n\nd. The kind classifier is an overt lexical realization of the operator , which takes\na kind and gives back the set of subkinds according to a partition.\n(14) a. wu = Px.P(x)| (x)| = 5\n1 k\nb. yi = 1\n(13b) is an instance of C/Ms with both counting and measuring readings. Since in\nphrases such as yi ping shui ‘one bottle water’ the number expresses the quantity of bottle, the\natom,  (x), is a member of the intersection of bottle and the context variable k. CONTAIN is\n1\na relation for containers on the counting reading. (13c) is an example of standard measures\nwith a measuring reading. The first lambda-bound variable of (13c) is different from that of\n(13a) and (13b) because X. Li (2011: 151) claims that a C/M with a measuring reading forms\na constituent with Num first, while those with a count reading, such as (13a) and (13b),\nmerge with a kind N first. (13d) should be evident by itself.\nThe semantics of numbers in (14) are proposed in X. Li (2011: 149-151). It is important\nto note that numbers have different semantics for different readings: on the one hand, there\nare C/Ms with a measure reading only, and on the other hand there are those with a count\nreading and those with both count and measure readings. Let’s see the diverse semantic\nderivations below.\n(15) a. yun = CLOUD\nb. duo yun = x. (x)(CLOUDk)Blossom-form( (x)) (x)=k\n1 1 2\nc. wu duo yun = x. (x)*(CLOUDk)*Blossom-form( (x))| (x)| =5\n1 1 1 k\n (x)=k\n2\n(16) a. shui = WATER\nb. wu ping shui = x. (x)(BOTTLEk)  CONTAIN( (x), WATER)\n1 1\n24\n\n| (x)|=5  (x)=k\n1 2\n(17) a. yi jin = kx.xkPOUND(x)=1\nb. mi = RICE\nc. yi jin mi = x.xRICEPOUND(x)=1\nAs shown in (15)-(17), numbers play different roles and hence have different semantics.\nIn (15) and (17) wu ‘five’ takes the phrase consisting of a C/M and a kind noun as its\nargument, while in (17) yi ‘one’ instantiates the n argument in jin ‘pound’, and the phrase\ncomposed of yi and jin takes a noun as its argument.\nJiang (2012) also adopts the idea that Chinese nouns are kind-referring and a C/M\ntransform a kind-denoting noun into a set, i.e. <e, t>, so that the atoms in this set can be dealt\nwith. She claims that this provides a unified account for C/Ms in Chinese because “standard\nmeasures classifiers, like bang ‘pound’, measure parts under sum; kind classifiers, like zhong\n‘kind, measure sub-kinds; container classifiers, like wan bowl’, measure parts via a\nfill-in-relation with respect to the noun; group classifier like qun ‘group’ measure sets formed\nas groups; partitive classifiers, such as ceng ‘layer’ measure partitions.” (Jiang 2012: 139).\nNote that Jiang also uses the term ‘classifiers’ for all C/Ms.\nWhile all of the works above are enlightening in deciphering the semantics of C/Ms in\nChinese, they face some challenges. First, they all assume that Chinese nouns are either kind\nor mass. As pointed out above, Chinese nouns cannot express kind because, standing alone\nwithout a classifier or as a bare noun, a Chinese noun does not (necessarily) have a kind\ninterpretation. Moreover, the hypothesis that Chinese nouns are mass has been seriously\nchallenged as well. For example, Yi (2009, 2011a, 2011b), adopting a similar mathematical\nperspective on C/Ms as we do, argues specifically that a lexical distinction of mass/count\n25\n\ndistinction is needed in Chinese as well as other classifier languages. Kuo and Wu (2010)\npropose specific syntactic tests for mass/count distinction in Chinese.10\nParticularly, Yi (to appear) argues against what he refers to as a (revised) individualizer\ntheory, where classifiers are considered as some type of ‘individualizer’, which functions to\n‘individualize’ a kind or mass and transforms the kind/mass to atoms, because such an\nanalysis leads to inconsistencies in both linguistic facts and the syntactic interactions between\nnumeral, classifiers and head nouns.\nFurthermore, Her & Hsieh (2010) and Her (2012) demonstrate that it is not possible for\na C to serve as an ‘individualizer’, and thus that count nouns must be recognized lexically.\nHer & Hsieh (2010: 533) use yi gen xiangjiao ‘one C banana’ as an example and argue that:\nUnder this view [all Chinese nouns are mass], xiangjiao ‘banana’ can only refer to the banana mass, and\nthe reading of a natural unit of banana with peel is only accidental and due to the classifier gēn, which ‘carves\nout’ an elongated discrete unit. This view thus predicts that (5) [yì gēn xiangjiao ‘one C banana’], besides this\nnatural reading, can also mean an elongated unit of bits or pieces of the banana substance or mashed banana.\nSuch a reading is simply impossible.\nThe second challenge is related to the first. Krifka (1995) utilizes an OU to take a kind\nas an input and the specimens of the kind as output. Rothestein (2010) uses a  operator for a\nsimilar purpose. Chierchia (2010) suggests that classifiers perform such a function. Yet, it is\nnot clear how these operators can distinguish nouns that allow this operation from those that\ndo not. There are nouns in Chinese that behave parallel to mass nouns in English, e.g., shui\n‘water’ and mianfen ‘flour’, in that they do not have atoms in their semantics. Obviously, OU\nor  cannot apply to such nouns, as no Cs can go with such nouns, which allow Ms only.\n26\n\nIn X. Li’s (2011) account, numbers come in two different semantics, depending on the\ndifferent readings of a [Num C/M N] expression. A unified semantics for numbers is of\ncourse preferred, which is the case under our proposal for the semantics of C/Ms.\nIn order to capture the semantic distinction between C and M that we have argued for,\nwe utilize Link’s (2003[1983]) semantics of mass nouns and plural nouns,11 where the\nsemantics of a singular count noun is a set of entities denoted by the noun. He proposes a *\noperator, which takes a set of entities and produces all of the individual sums of the entities.\nThe sum operation is represented as . If  is an individual and  is another individual, then\n is also an individual (i.e., individual sum), composed of  and , which can be\nconsidered as a plural individual. Here is an example.\n(18) a. gou = {Xiaobái, Xiaohuáng, Xiaohēi}\nb.\nXiǎobáiXiǎohuángXiǎohēi\nXiǎobáiXiǎohuáng XiǎobáiXiǎohēi XiǎohuángXiǎohēi\n(18a) is a set of three dogs: Xiaobai, Xiaohuang, and Xiaohei. This is the semantics of\nsingular count noun gou ‘dog’. The * operator applies to gou ‘dog’ and forms the semantics\nof plural gou: all of the individual sums of the three dogs, i.e., (18b). Under this definition,\nthe starred noun now has the same cumulative property as a mass noun. A plural noun and a\nmass noun are both closed under sum formation. Any sum of parts of a plural noun is again\nthe plural noun and any sum of a mass noun is again the mass noun. In (18) for example, if\nwe perform sum operation on XiaobaiXiaohuang and XiaobaiXiaohei, we get\nXiaobaiXiaohuang XiaobaiXiaohei, reducible to XiaobaiXiaohuangXiaohei. If we\nexecute sum operation on XiaohuangXiaohei and XiaobaiXiaohuangXiaohei, we get\n27\n\nXiaohuangXiaohei XiaobaiXiaohuangXiaohei, which, again, can be reduced to\nXiaobaiXiaohuangXiaohei. Pick any two individuals in (18b) and perform sum operation,\nyou get an individual in (18b). This is the cumulative property for plural nouns and mass\nnouns. Combining (18a) and (18b), wet get (19):\n(19)\nXiaobaiXiaohuangXiaohei\nXiaobaiXiaohuang XiaobaiXiaohei XiaohuangXiaohei\nXiaobai Xiaohuang Xiaohei\nIn (19), the bottom level is the atomic level, where the elements in this level are atoms,\ni.e. individual dogs. The other levels are non-atomic individual (sum) level, where the\nelements in these levels are plural individuals, that is, an individual composed of two or three\ndogs.\nBase",
