FAULCONER\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nOne view of sentence comprehension is that word meanings are retrieved independently and\nthen combined; another view is that the retrieved meanings for words are context dependent\nand thus different in different sentences. To examine retrieval of a noun's meaning in the context\nof an adjective, spoken sentences were probed with a picture. Subjects were instructed to respond\npositively if the picture illustrated a noun in the sentence (e.g., house), regardless of other infor-\nmation in the sentence (burning house) or in the picture. Even when the probe appeared immedi-\nately after an adjectiv~noun pair, an atypical picture incorporating the adjective was responded\nto more rapidly than a more typical picture. The results suggest that a noun's meaning is re-\ntrieved in conjunction with the adjective, not independently, when the phrase describes a familiar\nconception such as a burning house.\nA Central issue in the study of language Moreover, such an approach is well suited to\ncomprehension is how the meanings of explain the productivity of language com-\nwords are combined to reach an understand- prehension.
