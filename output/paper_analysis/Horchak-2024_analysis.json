In Experiments 1 to 2B, participants (total N =273) read sentences that either implied a\nEvent representation minimal change of an object’s state (e.g., “Jane chose a mango”) or a substantial change (e.g., “Jane stepped on a\nObject state mango”) and then verified whether a subsequently pictured object was mentioned in the sentence. Crucially, the\nSemantic similarity\npicture either showed the original/modified state of an object that was mentioned in the sentence (e.g., “mango”\nin Experiment 1) or not (e.g., “banana” in Experiments 2A and 2B). The results of Experiment 1 demonstrated\nthat the objects in a modified state were verified faster when a sentence implied a substantial state-change rather\nthan a minimal state-change. In contrast, the reverse was true for the objects in the original state. Importantly,\nverification latencies of pictures depicting original and modified states of an object in the substantial state-\nchange condition were approximately similar, thus suggesting that language comprehenders maintain multiple\nrepresentations of an object in different states. The results of Experiments 2A and 2B revealed that when par-\nticipants had to indicate that a pictured object (e.g., banana) was not mentioned in the sentence, their verifi-\ncation latencies were slowed down when the sentence contained a semantically related item (e.g., mango) and\ndescribed this item as being changed substantially by the action. However, these verification latencies varied\ncontinuously with the degree of change: the more dissimilar the states of a semantically related item, the less\ntime participants needed to verify a pictured object. The results are discussed through the prism of theories\nemphasizing dynamic views of event cognition.\nIntroduction environmental context, such as the setting in which an event takes place\n(e.g., Horchak & Garrido, 2022; Horton & Rapp, 2003; Yaxley & Zwaan,\nMany theories of event cognition and language processing suggest 2007).
