Supporting evidence is derived\nfrom the matching effects in the sentence-picture verification (SPV) task often used to assess mental simulations of object\nproperties, such as size, orientation, and shape. However, mixed results have been obtained regarding object colour, with\nresearchers reporting matching or mismatching effects. This study investigated the impact of colour information clarity\nwithin sentences on the process of mental simulation during language comprehension. Employing the SPV task and using\nnovel objects, we examined whether there is a mental simulation of colour after excluding typical/atypical colour bias\nand how varying levels of colour information clarity in sentences influence the emergence of matching effects at different\nstages of comprehension. To address these issues, we conducted two experiments. In Experiment 1, the participants read\nnormal sentences and subsequently engaged in picture verification with a novel object after a 500 ms delay. In Experiment\n2, the participants encountered sentences containing both clear and unclear colour information and, after either a 0 ms or\n1500 ms interval, completed picture verification tasks with a novel object. Null effects were found in the 500 ms condition\nfor normal sentences and the 0 ms condition for unclear colour information sentences. A mismatching effect appeared in\nthe 0 ms condition after clear colour information sentences, and a matching effect appeared in the 1500 ms condition for all\nsentences. The results indicated that after excluding colour bias, the participants still formed mental simulations of colour\nduring language comprehension. Our results also indicated that ongoing colour simulation with time pressure impacted the\nparticipant responses. The participants ignored unclear colour information under time pressure, but without time pressure,\nthey constructed simulations that were as detailed as possible, regardless of whether the implicit colour information in the\nsentence was clear.\nKeywords Mental simulation · Colour · Language comprehension · Sentence-picture verification task · Comprehension\nstages · Embodied cognition\nIntroduction\nTheories of grounded cognition suggest that people com-\nEditors: Hamad Al-Azary (Lawrence Technological University); prehend language through mental simulations grounded in\nReviewers: two researchers who prefer to remain anonymous.\nthe sensorimotor system (Barsalou 1999, 2008).

    "abstract": "Many studies have shown that mental simulation may occur during language comprehension. Supporting evidence is derived\nfrom the matching effects in the sentence-picture verification (SPV) task often used to assess mental simulations of object\nproperties, such as size, orientation, and shape. However, mixed results have been obtained regarding object colour, with\nresearchers reporting matching or mismatching effects. This study investigated the impact of colour information clarity\nwithin sentences on the process of mental simulation during language comprehension. Employing the SPV task and using\nnovel objects, we examined whether there is a mental simulation of colour after excluding typical/atypical colour bias\nand how varying levels of colour information clarity in sentences influence the emergence of matching effects at different\nstages of comprehension. To address these issues, we conducted two experiments. In Experiment 1, the participants read\nnormal sentences and subsequently engaged in picture verification with a novel object after a 500 ms delay. In Experiment\n2, the participants encountered sentences containing both clear and unclear colour information and, after either a 0 ms or\n1500 ms interval, completed picture verification tasks with a novel object. Null effects were found in the 500 ms condition\nfor normal sentences and the 0 ms condition for unclear colour information sentences. A mismatching effect appeared in\nthe 0 ms condition after clear colour information sentences, and a matching effect appeared in the 1500 ms condition for all\nsentences. The results indicated that after excluding colour bias, the participants still formed mental simulations of colour\nduring language comprehension. Our results also indicated that ongoing colour simulation with time pressure impacted the\nparticipant responses.
