A hypothesis of a single origin seems appealing to account for\nthis particular pattern of distribution. We propose that in Asia and the\nPacific numeral classifiers developed indigenously in one language group\ninitially and all other classifier languages acquired this feature via language\ncontact. The hypothesis thus excludes Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea,\nand the Americas, pending further research. Based on the evidence\navailable, we argue that, betweenTai-Kadaiand Sinitic, the latter is more\nlikely the single origin for Asia and the Pacific, and we also consider a\npossible cause of the rise of classifiers in Sinitic.\nKeywords:numeral classifier,measure word,single origin,Sinitic,Tai-\nKadai\n1. Introduction\nNumeral classifiers typically appear with a numeral quantifier. This feature cru-\ncially distinguishes them from noun classes, or genders, which form an integral\npartofanoun,havingnothingtodowiththepresenceorabsenceofanumeral\nquantifier.MandarinChineseisagoodexampleofalanguagewithnumeralclas-\nsifiers.Asshownin(1a–b),whenanounisquantifiedbyanumeral,anadditional\nelement,knownas‘numeralclassifier’,isrequired,whereastheEnglishcounter-\nparts are formed by just a numeral and a noun.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.362.05her\n©2023 John Benjamins Publishing Company\n\n114 One-SoonHer&Bing-TsiongLi\n(1) Numeral classifiers in Mandarin Chinese\na. sange nanren\n3 clf.generalman\n“three men”\nb. sanke xigua\n3 clf.roundwatermelon\n“three watermelons”\nInmostclassifierlanguages,thepositionoftheclassifier(CLF)canalsobefilled\nby a measure word (MENS), as in (2a–b).

The two subcategories, classifiers and measure words, are also\nknown as ‘sortal classifiers’ and ‘mensural classifiers’ (e.g., Huang 2013; Saikia\n& Allassonnière-Tang, this volume), and ‘classifiers’ and ‘massifiers’ (e.g., Cheng\n& Sybesma 1998), respectively, among various other lesser-known terms.

Jones (1970) and a number of other\nscholars have suggested that this areal feature is due to areal diffusion with Tai\nas the original center, though the dominant view among linguists in China is\nthat C/Ms developed independently first in Sinitic languages (e.g., Wang 1994).\nSuch characterizations have often led to an earlier misconception that C/Ms do\n\nChapter5.

(Comrie 2013)\nSincetherelationbetweenthenandthebase,e.g.,èr“two”andshí“ten”inMan-\ndarin is multiplication, the linear order between the two is irrelevant and does\nindeed vary across languages.\nAsfornumeralclassifiers,asmentionedabove,thepositionwhereaclassifier\nappears can also be filled by a measure word. How to distinguish between clas-\nsifiers and measure words has been a contentious issue (e.g., Hsieh 2008; Her\n& Hsieh 2010). Her (2012) proposes a precise multiplication-based account for\nthisdistinction,synthesizingtheinsightsgainedfromLandman(2004),AuYeung\n(2005,2007),andYi(2009),i.e.,[NumC/M]canbeseenmathematicallyas[mul-\ntiplier×multiplicand],exactlylikethe[nbase]relationinanumeralsuchasèr‑shí\n(two-ten)“twenty”,asdemonstratedin(4a–b)forclassifiersand(5a–b)formea-\nsure words.\n\n122 One-SoonHer&Bing-TsiongLi\n(4) Multiplication in a Mandarin Chinese classifier construction\na. sange pingguo (Num × CLF=3 × 1)\n3 clf.generalapple\n“three apples”\nb. sanke pingguo (Num × CLF=3 × 1)\n3 clf.roundapple\n“three apples”\n(5) Multiplication in a Mandarin Chinese measure word construction\na. sanda pingguo (Num × MENS.dozen=3 × 12)\n3 mens.dozenapple\n“three dozen apples”\nb. sanxiang pingguo (Num × MENS.box=3 × box)\n3 mens.boxapple\n“three boxes of apples”\nFrom this mathematical perspective, classifiers and measure words are unified\nunder the function as multiplicands and also distinguished in terms of their\nrespectivevalues,i.e.,aclassifiermusthavetheprecisenumericalvalueof1,but\nameasurewordmustnot.Measurewordscanhaveanyvalue,numericalornon-\nnumerical, except 1 (Her 2012).

Specifically, 186 lan-\nguageshavebase-finalandC/M-finalwordorder,and27others,base-initialand\nC/M-initial.\nFigure4.

It is much more likely that numeral classifiers in\nAfrican languages arise by themselves from the noun class system.\nAnotherregionthatweleaveoutisPapuaNewGuinea,thoughthereisclear\nevidencesuggestingthatatleastsomePNGlanguagesdevelopedclassifiersunder\ntheinfluenceofAustronesianclassifierlanguages(Klamer2014:160),whichmay\nbeinturntheresultofcontactwithSMATTI.Ifthatisindeedthecase,PNGlan-\nguagesaretheninthecircleofinfluenceofourproposedsingleorigin.Although\nclassifiers in Austronesian will be discussed in Section3, we rule out PNG lan-\nguages partly because our data for PNG classifier languages are still rudimen-\ntary, but mainly because studies regarding linguistic prehistory of this area are\n\n126 One-SoonHer&Bing-TsiongLi\nrelatively scarce, and currently no inference regarding borrowing of classifiers\ncanbedrawn.\nAsforEurope,eventhoughtherearemanyclassifierlanguageswithinIndo-\nEuropean,especiallyintheIndo-AryanandIranianbranches,thehandfuliden-\ntified that are located in the European continent remain controversial.

First we examine language families in SMATTI in the order of the\nlanguagesinotherlanguagegroupsthatareyettobeidentified,andconversely,someclassifier\nlanguages identified may turn out to be misidentified.\n\nChapter5.

Situated between Sino-\nTibetan, Tai-Kadai, and Austroasiatic families, the distribution of Miao-Yao lan-\nguagesisrathersporadic,butcanstillbecategorizedintoMiao(Hmongic)inthe\nwest and Yao (Mienic) in the east, with the She language (畲語) being an out-\nlier. So far, we have confirmed that at least 14 are classifier languages. Again, we\nsuspectthatmanymorewillbeidentifieduponfurtherresearch,astheaccepted\nviewisthatclassifiersystemsareacommonMiao-Yaofeature.Bu(2011a)summa-\nrizes the grammatical functions of classifiers and the size of classifier inventory,\nclaimingspecificallythattheintensityofclassifieruseisthegreatestinTai,where\nalargeinventoryofclassifiersservesmanysyntacticfunctions,islessinMiao-Yao,\nwhose classifiers have a comparable size of inventory but a more restricted syn-\ntacticposition,andultimatelyistheleastinTibeto-Burman,whereclassifiersare\nverylimitedinnumberanduse.Whatiscrucialtoourhypothesisisthefactthat\nno classifiers have been reconstructed for Proto-Miao-Yao (Wang & Mao 1995;\nRatliff2010)andtheborrowingofclassifiersfromSiniticlanguageshasbeenpro-\nposed (Ratliff 2000).\nHowever, as the history of Miao-Yao involves a long period of contacts with\nvariouslanguagefamilies,toidentifythesourcesoftheinfluenceisdifficult.His-\ntorically, Miao-Yao has had intensive contact with Sinitic languages. Based on\ngenetic and linguistic evidence, the homeland of the Miao-Yao people may have\nbeen from somewhere north of their current territories to the south of Yangtze\nRiver for more than 2000 years (Wen etal. 2004; Ratliff 2009:643). During the\nhistoryofChineseexpansion,Miao-Yaopeoplehavebeenforcedtomigratetothe\nsouthintomodernLaosandThailand(Blench2004).Languagecontactsbetween\nSinitic languages and Tai-Kadai, the two candidates for our single origin, are\ninevitable.\nAsfortheevidenceforthesourceoftheinfluence,classifiersinMiao-Yaolan-\nguagessharefeatureswithbothSiniticandTai-Kadailanguages,e.g.,Cantonese\nandTai.Forexample,abareclassifierphrase[CLFN]inMiao-Yaolanguagescan\nmarkdefiniteness,whichisafeaturealsofoundinsouthernSiniticlanguages,but\nnot in Mandarin (Bisang 1993; Li & Bisang 2012). In terms of word order, Tai-\nKadailanguagestothesouthhaveanN-initialorder(i.e.,[NNumCLF]),while\n\n130 One-SoonHer&Bing-TsiongLi\nSinitic languages, as well as Tai-Kadai languages in the north, have an N-final\norder(i.e.,[NumCLFN]).Miao-YaolanguagesarelikeSiniticlanguagesinthis\nregard (Enfield 2001:265).\nToresolvetheissue,wemayresortagaintodistribution.Haudricourt(1954)\nobservedthatMiao-YaoformsanintermediarygroupbetweenMon-Khmerand\nTibeto-Burman. This observation forms the basis for Bu’s (2011a) ‘concentric\nmodel’ofclassifierdiffusion.Basedonthesummarymentionedabove,Bu(2011a)\nclaims that the three language families form a concentric circle, with Tai-Kadai\nintheinnermostcircle,Miao-Yaotheintermediatecircle,andTibeto-Burmanthe\noutermost circle. The strength of classifiers becomes weaker and weaker further\nawayfromtheinnercircle,implyingascenarioofdiffusion.Wethussurmisethat\nMiao-Yao classifiers are not indigenous and have been influenced more by Tai-\nKadaithan by Chinese.\n3.2 Austroasiatic\nThe Austroasiatic family consists of 159 languages in Glottolog, in countries\nlocated between China and Indonesia, with two main groups, i.e., Mon-Khmer\n(137languages,54ofwhichareidentifiedinourdatabaseasaclassifierlanguage)\nandMunda(22languages,4classifierlanguages).Genetic,epigraphic,andethno-\ngraphicevidencesuggeststhatAustroasiaticpeople,oratleastthegeneticances-\ntors of Austroasiatic-speaking people, were the oldest inhabitants in peninsular\nSoutheastAsiafrom4000yearsB.P.onwards(Lertritetal.2008).Whiletheissue\nof the homeland and expansion of Austroasiatic languages remains contentious,\nevidence of language contact with other language families in SMATTI has been\nproposed.AseriesofwordsinOldChinesehavebeenproposedtohavebeenbor-\nrowedfromAustroasiatic(Norman&Mei1976;Schuessler2007).Longafterthe\ntimeofthisborrowingintheeraofOldChinese,theexpansionofTaipeopleinto\nthepeninsuladuringtheearlysecondmillenniumbroughtforthanotherwaveof\nlanguage contact. Lastly, the Munda branch, as an especially isolated branch in\nSouth Asia, is certainly in contact with and influenced by the Indo-Aryan lan-\nguages on the subcontinent.\nAdams (1991), following Jones (1970), hypothesizes that the classifier system\nisnotnativetoAustroasiaticbutisborrowedfromneighboringlanguagessuchas\nThai,Burmese,andChinese.Huffman(1973)comparesthesyntax,includingclas-\nsifiers,ofThaiandCambodianandcomestosupportsuchaclaim.Comparedto\nThai,Cambodianhasfewerclassifiers,andtheyareoptionalincolloquialforms.\nThis less intensive use of classifiers in Cambodian suggests a borrowed feature.\nTheclaimisfurthersupportedbytheabsenceofclassifiersinotherMon-Khmer\n\nChapter5. A single origin of numeral classifiers inAsiaandthePacific 131\nlanguagesandtherelativelystrongandwide-spreadclassifieruseinTailanguages\n(Huffman 1973).\nIn addition to Tai languages, there are other possible sources for classifiers\ninAustroasiaticlanguages,oneofwhichbeingSinitic.Vietnameseclassifiershave\nbeen heavily influenced by, or borrowed from, Chinese, though some uses are\ninnovations (e.g., Benedict 1947; Alves 2016). Munda languages, on the other\nhand,areinfluencedbyIndo-Aryaninmanyways,includingclassifiersystemsas\nwell(Emeneau1956).Thoughmorestudiesareneededtodrawafullerpictureof\nsourcesofclassifiersinvariousAustroasiaticlanguages,wesurmisethatclassifiers\narenotindigenousinthislanguagefamilyandhavebeeninfluencedbythesur-\nroundingIndo-Aryan,Tai-Kadai, and Sinitic languages.\n3.3 Tibeto-Burman\nAs shown in Section2.2, within SMATTI, only Tibeto-Burman has base-initial,\nC/M-initial languages, where the only five exceptions to the base-C/M harmo-\nnization are also located.

Note, however, that in Matisoff’s (2003) Handbook of\nProto-Tibeto-Burman,asingleclassifierforhumans,*ra,isfound,onp.609,listed\nin the Index of Proto-Forms. Yet, closer examination of related data in the book\nindicatesthat*rainPTBislikelyanoun,notaclassifier.Theonlybasisforcon-\nsidering *ra a classifier in PTB is given on p.170, where *k-ra is a PTB form\nmeaning “strength/win”. Matisoff (2003:170, fn. c) explains why this form *k-ra\nand its meaning suggest that *ra is a classifier: “This seems certainly to be the\nsamerootas*ra‘humans(classifier)’,above3.4.2.Cf.Englishexpressionslike‘20\nmenstrong’.”\nHowever, in the English expression 20 men strong or 20-man strong, men\nor man is neither a classifier nor a measure word under a proper definition of\nnumeral classifiers. Also, on p.43, in §3.4.2, which the above quote refers to, *ra\nislistedasaforminProto-Lolo-Burmese(PLB)meaning“CLFforhumans”,but\nnocorrespondingforminPTBisgiven,whiletheentryrightbelowis“snake”*m-\nəy in PLB and its PTB form *s-b-rul is given. These observations, coupled with\nthe fact that by far the majority of TB languages do not have classifiers, suggest\nstrongly that no classifiers should be reconstructed for PTB.\nInFigure6,weshowall465languagesinTB,withgreendotsbeingtheclas-\nsifierlanguagesandbluedotsforthelanguagesforwhichwehavenoinformation\non their classifiers.

Attested classifier languages and other languages inTibeto-Burman\n(green dots for classifier languages, blue dots fornon-classifierlanguages)\nIncidentally, word orders of numeral modifiers with respect to nouns may\nalso shed light on our hypothesis.

We are now testing this hypothesis using\nDryer’sdataonN-parameterinTibeto-Burmanandourdataonbase-parameter\nandC/M-parameterinTibeto-Burman.Inotherwords,weshouldfindstatistical\nsignificance in [N C/M base-n] and [n‑base C/M N] over other attested word\norders.ThehypothesishasbeenshowntobevalidinAllassonnière-Tang&Her\n(2020),whichaddsconsiderableweighttoourclaimregardingthestatusofclas-\nsifiers inTibeto-Burman.\n3.4 Dravidian\nThe next language group to be considered is Dravidian, a group located mainly\ninthesouthofSMATTI,especiallysouthofIndo-Aryan.Dravidianlanguagesare\nspoken in southern India, on the continent and on the islands of Lakshadweep,\nandontheislandofSriLanka.Theyarealsospokensporadicallyinotherparts\noftheIndiansubcontinent,includingBrahui,alanguagespokeninPakistanand\nAfghanistan.Inourdatabase,11Dravidianlanguagesarefoundtohaveclassifiers,\n\nChapter5.
