Understanding Noun Phrases

One view of sentence comprehension is that word meanings are retrieved independently and
then combined; another view is that the retrieved meanings for words are context dependent
and thus different in different sentences. To examine retrieval of a noun's meaning in the context
of an adjective, spoken sentences were probed with a picture. Subjects were instructed to respond
positively if the picture illustrated a noun in the sentence (e.g., house), regardless of other infor-
mation in the sentence (burning house) or in the picture. Even when the probe appeared immedi-
ately after an adjectiv~noun pair, an atypical picture incorporating the adjective was responded
to more rapidly than a more typical picture. The results suggest that a noun's meaning is re-
trieved in conjunction with the adjective, not independently, when the phrase describes a familiar
conception such as a burning house.
