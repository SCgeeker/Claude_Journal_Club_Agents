thatMTurkworkers15%and30%morelikelythanProlific

theotherhand,Prolificworkerswere40%morelikelythan
MTurkworkerstosetweeklygoals.
RQ3(A):GoalAttainmentStrategies
As stated previously, in order to answer this question, we
askedthreeclosed-endedquestionsaboutgoalachievement,
goalplanning,andtimemanagement.Inaddition,weasked
twoopen-endedquestionsregardingthetypesoftoolsused
forgoalplanningandmonitoring,aswellashowthesetools
arehelpful.
To see the difference in the scores, we conducted inde-
pendent samples T-test. The test indicated that goal attain-
ment score for MTurk was greater than Prolific workers
(t(203) = 3.26,p = .001,d = 0.45),goalplanningscores
were also higher for MTurk workers than Prolific workers
(t(203) = 2.19,p = .030,d = 0.30) and MTurk workers
also scored significantly higher in terms of time manage-
ment(t(203)=4.16,p<.001,d=0.58)–Fig.3.Therea-
son that MTurk workers scored higher could be due to the
hard-working conditions for MTurk workers (Martin et al.
2014; Lehdonvirta 2018), which allowed them to be better
organizedandwell-plannedtomeettheirtargets.
Next,weexaminedthetoolsmentionedbycrowdworkers
for goal planning and tracking. As depicted in the Fig. 4
and Fig. 5, the most frequently mentioned applications by
crowdworkerswereSpreadsheet(N =22),Calendar(N =
20),To-dolist(N = 23),Journal/diary(N = 15),Notepad
(N = 9), Reminders (N = 6), Notes (N = 7), Notebook
(N =6)andotherprograms(N =29).
Other applications mentioned by crowd workers can be
classified into several categories; for example, some work-
ersusedfitnesstrackers(N =9)andhealthapps(N =5)to
improve their overall health. Some workers (N = 3) over-

In addition to the standard tools for managing tasks,
such as to-do lists, reminders, journals etc., work-
ers also mentioned some tools they used explicitly
for goal setting and tracking. These include Notion
(notion.so), Coach.me (coach.me), GoalBuddy (goal-
buddy.io), Goalscape (goalscape.com), Lifetick (lifet-
ick.com), Trello (trello.com/home), Mint (mint.intuit.com),
Clickup (clickup.com), SMART (Doran et al. 1981), and
Discord(discord.com).
